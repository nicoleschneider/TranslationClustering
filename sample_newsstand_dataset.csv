The leaders said not all proposals made by regional leaders will be included in the final BBI report.  They said that Dr Ruto has no moral authority to stop the rallies on the basis of sentiments that would not influence the final report.  Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny claimed the DP has always been against the BBI.  ""If he [Dr Ruto] wants to oppose BBI, he has an option of saying yes or no. We are not forcing anyone to subscribe to our school of thought. Only Uhuru and Raila can stop the drive,"" said Mr Kutuny.  He said that not all what leaders say will be included in the final BBI report.  ""The only way they can stop the reggae is to oppose it. They can oppose the reggae and give us blues or RNB or even Lingala. He (Ruto) can come up with another vibe,"" Mr Kutuny said, adding that the DP's sentiments were ""desperate"" attempts by the anti-BBI brigade to stop the drive.  STOP RALLIES  Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Nyeri Town MP Wambugu Ngunjiri said the DP cannot stop the rallies ""because he did not start them.""  ""He has no capacity. He has more pressing issues to deal with before he drags himself into the BBI conversation. Let him clear his name in the multiple corruption cases he has been implicated in,"" said Mr Malala.  Mr Ngunjiri noted that the Deputy President cannot stop the BBI rallies because he did not start them.  Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said the problem with Dr Ruto and his allies is that their BBI catch-up strategy is not working.  ""The BBI train has left the station but they are struggling to hang on a fast moving BBI train. All their dirty schemes against BBI have crumbled. They tried to sneak the BBI report to Parliament, it didn't work. They tried to conduct parallel rallies, it never worked. They tried to introduce Luhya supremacy narrative ahead of Kakamega rally, it never worked,"" said Mr Osotsi.  He added: ""They then tried to hijack BBI rally in Kitui, it never worked. They tried to cause unnecessary drama in Narok by raising petty issues on language translation issues, it did not work. They are panicking and facing a political catastrophe as evidenced by numerous leaders who are exiting their camp to join BBI train.""  The ANC nominated MP said Dr Ruto should be bold enough to oppose BBI instead of sending mixed signals that are contradicting his boss President Kenyatta.  HANDSHAKE  ""They can't also purport to support BBI while at the same time belittling the handshake. The handshake and BBI are intertwined. Incessant attacks on Raila are a direct attack on Uhuru and his government,"" added Mr Osotsi.  MPs Chris Omulele (Luanda), Florence Mutua (Busia County) and Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) said the BBI train had taken off and only the two principals -- President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga -- with the support of Kenyans can stop it.  ""The Deputy President should wake up and smell the coffee. BBI is bigger than him. It is a national re-evaluation of our ethics, cohesion and aspirations,"" Mr Omulele said.  He added: ""It was mooted by the President and Mr Odinga on behalf of Kenyans and the DP does not need to be reminded of this.""  ""If the DP imagines that the BBI is about him and his personal ambitions, he has missed the train by a mile. He will, therefore, not be available to dance to music he can't hear or understand because he will simply have failed to attend the party,"" added Mr Omulele.  Ms Mutua said that ""in as much as I personally don't support any tribal whipping and incitement, it is also wrong to use what one leader said to try and blame it on BBI.""  ""No one will stop reggae and the DP and his supporters should come to the BBI meetings and air their views too,"" Ms Mutua said.  THREATS  Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo cautioned Dr Ruto against issuing threats over the BBI drive.  ""Let him stop his threats and pettiness. No one can stop a mass movement,"" said Mr Odhiambo.  On Sunday, Dr Ruto told leaders, whom he did not name, that Kenya is a God-fearing nation and that a few self-centred people will not be allowed to plunge it into political turmoil.  ""When the leaders spoke at Narok's BBI rally, they spoke of dividing Kenyans. As the government, this is not what we want.""  He stressed that the BBI is meant to unite Kenyans, not divide them.  After violence was witnessed at the BBI rally in Kitui County, DP Ruto noted that this is not the way to approach the debate.  He said bridges cannot be built with violence and that each person has a right to be heard as the BBI matter concerns all Kenyans.  "

He also was ordered to pay about $6,000 in restitution.  Bonnell had two alleged accomplices in the killing.

There they found Lavalley’s body. He was shot twice in the face.  Howson told police that he, Bonnell and French were with Lavalley over the weekend. Howson said Lavalley had made unwanted sexual contact with French and this angered Bonnell, who was her boyfriend, and the others.  French told police they all took Lavalley to where his body would later be found.

On three central issues, however, Trump gave out misinformation that had to be corrected later, spreading panic everywhere from European airports to the financial markets. It was the latest in a series of confusing, misleading or inaccurate statements from administration officials on a matter of life and death to people in the U.S. and around the world.  Trump said the U.S. would “be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,” but within hours statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security clarified that it did not apply to legal permanent residents, or immediate family members of U.S. citizens. The fear of being stranded in Europe resulted in a  pre-dawn rush to airports  in tourist meccas such as Barcelona by American travelers trying to book flights home.  President Trump addressing the nation about the coronavirus on Wednesday. (Doug Mills/New York Times via AP, Pool)  Trump also said in his address that the restrictions would apply to “the tremendous amount of trade and cargo” across the Atlantic, but an hour later on Twitter he clarified that “the restriction stops people not goods.” The president also said that insurance companies were waiving copayments for testing and treatment related to coronavirus, but a hospital and insurance lobbying firm  It was not the first time inaccurate coronavirus information came from the White House. Last week  , Vice President Mike Pence had to correct Trump  about the rules on testing. In a White House briefing, Trump said “anybody that needs a test gets a test” for coronavirus, a misleading statement at the time and still not the case. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has badly lagged other countries in preparing a nationwide testing regime. Yet Trump repeated his claim on Thursday, stating, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth.”  Around the same time, across town on Capitol Hill, Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and serves on the White House coronavirus task force, was telling Congress that testing was going anything but smoothly.  “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” said Fauci. “This is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it. The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that.”  As of Thursday morning  , the CDC was testing only 100 people per day  , a small fraction of those seeking to be tested. Some additional tests were being administered by state public-health agencies and private laboratories, but still far below the rate of testing in other countries.   On Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”  On Feb. 26, Trump said at a coronavirus briefing, “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”  As of Thursday the United States recorded 1,300 cases, with 38 deaths.  "

Unfortunately, the state of the movie industry being what it is right now, that isn't possible and we all have to wait until next year to see Michael Myers back at it again. But Blumhouse Productions head Jason Blum has promised that, come hell or high water, the upcoming entry in the franchise is coming out next October. During a recent interview for the Welcome to the Blumhouse series and The Craft: Legacy, Jason Blum, who serves as a key producer on Halloween Kills, was asked about a further delay, possibly to 2022. Given the uncertain nature of the world currently, it is a reasonable question. Be that as it may, Blum did not mince words in his response. Here's what he had to say about it. RELATED: John Carpenter Praises Halloween Kills as the 'Quintessential Slasher Film' ""No [laughs]. If this is still going on next Halloween? No, we're not holding it. Halloween Kills is coming out next October come hell or high water, vaccine or no vaccine. It is coming out."" So there you have it. Michael Myers will be back in Haddonfield mixing it up with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. As we've seen recently, moviegoers are, by and large, still hesitant to go to theaters right now. Tenet and The New Mutants did not draw big crowds and what few movies are available are not tempting enough to get most people to take on the risk. It is believed that traditional theaters will not be completely safe until a vaccine is widely available. In the meantime, drive-ins have become a haven for lovers of the cinematic experience.  To that point, there is no telling what the movie industry is going to look like come Halloween 2021. Halloween Kills is coming out next year, Jason Blum is making that quite clear, but that doesn't mean the distribution strategy won't change. 2018's Halloween earned $255 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing slasher in history. It would greatly benefit Universal Pictures and Blumhouse to give the sequel a wide release in as many theaters as possible. But if that isn't feasible, they may have to get creative doing some sort of premium VOD release or something along those lines. But a lot can happen in a year. David Gordon Green is returning to the director's chair for the sequel. Franchise creator John Carpenter is also on board as an executive producer, in addition to doing the score. Carpenter recently called it, ""the quintessential slasher film."" Halloween Kills is currently set to hit theaters on October 15, 2021. Another sequel that will bring this version of the franchise to a close, titled Halloween Ends, is also planned. It is currently scheduled to arrive in October 2022. But meeting that date that will be dependent on getting production squared away by then. We'll be sure to keep you posted as any further details are made available. This news comes to us via Forbes.

Die Regierungschefs der Autoländer sprechen darüber. Volkswagen hat sich vor den Beratungen der Ministerpräsidenten von Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Württemberg über mögliche Auto-Kaufprämien in der Krise für eine weitreichende Förderung ausgesprochen.  Man werde sich dafür starkmachen, „dass die Politik Geld für diesen Impulsstoß bereitstellt“, erklärte VW-Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh am Mittwoch in einem Brief an die Mitarbeiter. „Wir wissen, dass wir damit nach Steuermitteln rufen“, heißt es in dem Schreiben, das der dpa vorliegt. „Aber wir wissen auch, dass sich dieses Geld für unsere gesamte Gesellschaft klug anlegen ließe und sich so gleich mehrfach rechnen könnte – nämlich ökonomisch, ökologisch und sozial.“ Generelle Kaufprämie oder Begrenzung auf E-Autos Die Regierungschefs der drei Autoländer – Stephan Weil (SPD), Markus Söder (CSU) und Winfried Kretschmann (Grüne) – wollen sich am Nachmittag zusammenschalten. Weil hatte am Montag zum Wiederanlauf des VW-Stammwerks Wolfsburg angekündigt, ein denkbares Prämienmodell zu prüfen: „Uns ist bewusst, dass wir eine schnelle Entscheidung brauchen.“ VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess forderte „baldige kraftvolle Maßnahmen“. Söder sagte der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“: „Ich bin für eine sehr umfassende Strategie, wie wir der Automobilindustrie helfen.“ Nach den Vorstellungen des VW-Betriebsrats sollte ein Fördermodell unter anderem eine „Impuls-Prämie“ für Neuwagenkäufe inklusive Leasing umfassen, die auch für moderne Verbrenner gilt und über „einen klar begrenzten Zeitraum“ läuft. Sie sollte ähnlich hoch sein wie die „Abwrackprämie“ in der Finanzkrise 2009 und sich auch auf junge Gebrauchtwagen bis zum Alter von einem Jahr erstrecken. Abwrackprämie zusätzlich Zudem möchte Osterloh eine „zusätzliche Abwrackprämie obendrauf“, die es für verschrottete Altautos der Abgasnormen Euro-3 und Euro-4 gibt. Die deutschen Hersteller sollten sich nach Meinung von VW einig sein, die staatlichen Mittel „je nach zugesagter Summe womöglich sogar zu verdoppeln, zumindest aber die Wechselkosten zu übernehmen“. Daneben solle der CO2-Ausstoß als Bemessungsgrundlage für die Kfz-Steuer stärker berücksichtigt werden.  Söder hatte in der vergangenen Woche erklärt, er wolle sich mit seinen beiden Kollegen aus Hannover und Stuttgart zusammensetzen, um etwa über ökologische Prämienmodelle nachzudenken und gerade der neuen Generation von Motoren und Autos nach der Phase des Durchhaltens eine Möglichkeit zu geben. Die Autobauer hatten wegen des Nachfrageeinbruchs und unterbrochener Lieferketten ihre Werke über mehrere Wochen schließen müssen – drastische Umsatzrückgänge sind die Folge. Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze (SPD) befürwortet neue Hilfen für die Autoindustrie, wenn sich die Förderung „auf klimaschonende Fahrzeuge“ konzentriert. (dpa)   Eine Buchempfehlung vom Verlag der Epoch Times Wenn der Staat eine aktive Rolle in der Wirtschaft spielt, hat jede Aktion einen Dominoeffekt auf den Markt. Neue Richtlinien und Gesetze können ganze Branchen verändern und viele Unternehmen und Investoren von den Entscheidungen der Regierung abhängig machen. Der Staat, der traditionell nur Gesetze verabschiedete und durchsetzte, ist dadurch ein führender Akteur in der Wirtschaft geworden.  Der Staat ist wie ein Schiedsrichter, der bei einem Fußballspiel auch noch zum Spieler wird: Er kontrolliert und reguliert das Kapital in einer Wirtschaft, die früher privat war und ersetzt damit die „unsichtbare Hand“ durch die „sichtbare Hand“. Es gibt mindestens zwei Hauptfolgen der umfangreichen staatlichen Eingriffe. Erstens erweitert sich die Macht des Staates hinsichtlich seiner Rolle und seines Umfangs. Regierungsbeamte entwickeln zunehmend Überheblichkeit hinsichtlich ihrer Fähigkeit, in die Wirtschaft einzugreifen und den Staat die Rolle des Retters spielen zu lassen. Auch nach der Bewältigung einer Krise behält die Regierung für gewöhnlich ihre erweiterten Befugnisse und Funktionen bei – wie im Kapitel 9 des Buches „Wie der Teufel die Welt beherrscht“ analysiert wird.  Zweitens führt der Interventionismus zu mehr Abhängigkeit von der Regierung. Wenn die Menschen auf Herausforderungen stoßen oder wenn der freie Markt nicht die Vorteile bieten kann, die sie sich wünschen, werden sie sich für mehr staatliche Eingriffe einsetzen, um ihre Forderungen erfüllt zu bekommen. Hier weitere Informationen und Leseproben.

Booked for diving late on. 5 Rodri Told off by Guardiola for one backwards pass than put Akanji under pressure and was never at his best. 6 Ilkay Gundogan Couple of loose passes and heavy touches in the first half set the tone for City's struggles. Had to do better with a second-half chance and then let Toney in front of him for the dramatic late winner. 4 Kevin De Bruyne Had his fair share of injury disappointment during tournament football so hard to blame him for being cautious, but bar one spell in the first half he was fairly quiet. 6 Bernardo Silva Bright down the left and almost won a penalty with one fine flick past Henry. Nimble footwork kept Brentford on their toes. 7 Phil Foden Started like he was lacking rhythm, which was understandable after his recent lack of action, but took his goal quite brilliantly. 7 Erling Haaland Have to wonder how fit he was. Did his best to reach a couple of crosses that were just too heavy and did set Gundogan up for a golden chance, but didn't carry his usual threat. 6  Substitutes  Julian Alvarez Had one chance on the breakaway but delayed a decision too long and then passed the ball behind Haaland. 5   READ NEXT: "

The scheme, which was developed by Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe and Tourism Minister Catherine Martin, is the centrepiece of the Government's July Stimulus Package.                                                                                                                                                                   The Government is still deciding how the rebate can be claimed but it is examining whether an online system or an app could be used to make claiming the rebate as customer-friendly as possible.                                                                                                                                                    The economic stimulus will include several business- focused measures aimed at assisting employers who have been severely affected by the coronavirus.                                                                                                                                                                    This includes extending the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWWS) into the new year, continuing the waiver on commercial rates and allowing businesses to defer their VAT bills for a period without being penalised.                                                                                                                                                    Meanwhile, small-town Ireland is set to receive a major boost through a range of measures aimed at reviving rural towns and villages in the Government's stimulus package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The Covid-19 mini budget will include more funding schemes aimed at creating employment and businesses in small rural communities.                                                                                                                                                   This includes expanding the Restart Grant scheme to allow B&Bs and sports clubs to draw down funding of €4,000 to €25,000 a piece.                                                                                                                                                                    There will also be new funding for community centres seeking to reopen while adhering to health and safety standards.                                                                                                                                                    A €20m fund will also be created to back local businesses such as boutiques or menswear shops that want to sell clothes online.                                                                                                                                                                    And there will be a €10m investment in the existing Town and Village Scheme which supports local initiatives aimed at rejuvenating rural communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 There are also plans to create an extra 23,000 places on Community Employment Schemes.                                                                                                                                                                   The Government wants to ensure there is a balance between investment in urban and rural areas under the July Stimulus Package.                                                                                                                                                   A senior government source said: ""We want to make sure it is spread across the country and it's not just urban- centred.""                                                                                                                                                   Climate Action Minister Eamon Ryan is expected to announce a €100m retrofitting scheme which will create employment and reduce carbon emissions.                                                                                                                                                                    Catherine Martin, who is also Culture Minister, will also announce new funding to allow venues to hold live performances again while adhering to social distancing rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Theatres and concert venues have been forced to close their doors for months due to Covid and it is hoped the funding will help them prepare to reopen to the public in the coming months.                                                                                                                                                    Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien has secured around €60m to buy and refurbish vacant houses. The additional funding will be used to create business for small contractors and get more people off the housing list.

Another 41% said that Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they 'don't know.'  Among Democrats, 74% said Trump should be impeached, up 8 points over the past week, while 13% of Republicans said they supported impeachment, up 3 points. It was unchanged among independents at 37%.  The American public has been increasingly focused on the question of impeachment following a whistleblower complaint about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  The U.S. House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry of Trump last week after a whistleblower report raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for a political favor from Zelinskiy involving an investigation of Joe Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic presidential contender.  The poll of more than 2,200 U.S. adults found that 34% had heard 'a great deal' about the Ukraine scandal this week, about twice the number of people who had been paying close attention when compared with last week.   Another 30% said they have heard 'some' details about the Ukraine call.  When asked what they thought about the news, 43% said 'president Trump is trying to smear Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign,' up 4 points from last week.  The poll also found that 66% of American adults said any elected official 'should be removed' from office if they work with a foreign government to attack a political rival. That included 46% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats and about two-thirds of independents.  The fact that a smaller number of respondents - 45% - said that Trump should be impeached, however, suggests that many of them did not believe allegations against Trump or had yet to conclude Trump had indeed worked with Ukraine to damage Biden.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,234 adults, including 944 Democrats and 855 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.  Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment investigation is only the start of what will be an epic legal and constitutional clash.  Here is how impeachment goes from here.  1) Investigations step up  Six committees are now tasked by Pelosi with investigating Donald Trump with the intention of deciding whether he should be impeached. They are the House Judiciary, Oversight, Intelligence, Ways and Means, Financial Services and Foreign Affairs committees. All of them are now likely to issue a flurry of subpoenas which is certain to lead to a new:   2) Court battle over subpoenas - which could go to the Supreme Court  The Trump administration has so far resisted subpoenas by claiming executive privilege and is certain to continue to do so. Federal judges are already dealing with litigation over subpoenas for Trump's tax and financial records and many more cases are likely to follow. But the courts have never settled the limits of executive privilege and whether an impeachment inquiry effectively gives Congress more power to overcome it. If Trump fights as hard as he can, it is likely to make its way to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, expect:   3) More hearings  Democrats know they need to convince the public that Trump needs to be put on trial and the best way to do that is hearings like those which electrified the nation during Watergate. They botched the Mueller hearing but if they produce question and answer sessions with people from Trump-world which cause public outrage, they are on their way to:  4) Drawing up formal articles of impeachment in committee   The charge sheet for impeachment - the 'articles' - set out what Trump is formally accused of. It has no set format - it can be as long or as short as Congress decides. Three such set of articles have been drawn up - for Andrew Johnson on 1868, Richard Nixon in 1974, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Johnson's were the most extensive at 11, Nixon faced three, and Bill Clinton four but with a series of numbered charges in each article. Once drawn up, the judicial committee votes on them and if approved, sends them to the House for:  5) Full floor vote on impeachment  The constitution says the House needs a simple majority to proceed, but has to vote on each article. Nixon quit before such a vote so Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only precedent. The House passed two out of the three articles against Clinton and all 11 against Johnson. Passing even one article leads to:  6) Senate impeachment trial  Even if the Senate is clearly not in favor of removing the president, it has to stage a trial if the House votes for impeachment. The hearing is in not in front of the full Senate, but 'evidentiary committees' - in theory at least similar to the existing Senate committees. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over it, but the procedures are set by senators. Members of the House prosecute Trump as 'managers,' bringing witnesses and presenting evidence to set out their case against the president. The president can defend himself, or, as Clinton did, use attorneys to cross-examine the witnesses. The committee or committees report to the full Senate. Then it can debate in public or deliberate in private on the guilt or innocence of the president. It holds a single open floor vote which will deliver:  7) The verdict  Impeachment must be by two-thirds of the Senate. Voting for impeachment on any one article is good enough to remove the president from office. There is no appeal.   Rihanna appears to have lost weight as she has to pull up her jeans when exiting a car... in her first appearance since Aaron Carter's tattoo tribute  Meghan Markle's best friend Misha Nonoo shares stunning first images of herself in the 'one of a kind' lace bridal gown she designed for her wedding to Mikey Hess  'Once she got her greenlight she didn't have to play nice': Wendy Williams is 'struggling to book high profile guests' as insiders say she's back to her 'mean girl ways'   Simon Cowell displays his lithe physique while soaking up the sun in Mexico with girlfriend Lauren Silverman and their son Eric, five, after shedding 20lbs  Eva Longoria spices up a chic python print ensemble with fuchsia stilettos and a coordinating clutch as she attends Sotheby's 275th anniversary bash  Justin Bieber and wife Hailey hold screening of The Notebook as well as time at the shooting range for guests ahead of their second wedding in South Carolina  Fit for a prince!

In sport, everything. From childhood, we come to see the head start in the playground race, the shove in the goalmouth, a rogue thumb on the egg (and spoon) as unjust, and quickly, loudly, “Oi!” object.The same sense of probity works its way up into professional sport. Sandpapering a cricket ball: not fair. Boxing with loaded gloves: not fair. Intentional misrepresentation in Paralympic classification: not fair. Colluding with betting syndicates to fix a result: not fair. Doping in sport: not fair.We classify our sports in order to pitch like against like and to keep people safe. Heavyweight boxers never fight flyweights. From puberty, the sexes compete separately in most sports most of the time. These are long accepted norms. Or were.Laurel Hubbard, 43, is poised to become the first transgender Olympian after being picked for New Zealand’s weightlifting team. Bubbling up to be one of Tokyo’s big stories, this fixes the spotlight on to whether trans women have an unfair advantage over biological women, and pits those sometimes friends, sometimes foes, inclusion and fairness.By conflating gender and sex, I would argue we fudge the very reason we have sex categories in sport: the male performance advantage. Without a separate category for females, there would be no women in Olympic finals. Even in the 100m, one of the events with the smallest performance gap, approximately 10,000 men worldwide have personal bests faster than the current Olympic female champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah (10.70sec). And it’s not just track and field. While the smallest attainment gap between the sexes comes in running, rowing and swimming events (11-13%), this moves up to 16%-22% in track cycling, and between 29% and 34% when it comes to bowling cricket balls and weightlifting. The difference in punch power between men and women is a whopping 162%. Not, then, to be sniffed at. But the International Olympic Committee tweaked its guidelines in 2015 to allow athletes such as Hubbard to compete in the women’s category, provided their total testosterone level in serum is kept below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months. Transgender men face no restrictions in the male category for obvious reasons.Increasingly, however, research is showing that these testosterone guidelines do not guarantee the “fair competition” the IOC was hoping for. Ross Tucker, a sports scientist and expert on testosterone advantage in sport, succinctly sums it up: “Lowering of testosterone is almost completely ineffective in taking away the biological differences between males and females.” There is just no proof that reducing testosterone takes away the advantage of muscle mass, strength, lean body mass, muscle size or bone density. Despite this new evidence from Drs Emma Hilton and Tommy Lundberg, the IOC has put off any further decisions making until after Tokyo and left it up to individual sports federations to decide their own transgender policies. Some have been bold, others have written their policies alongside trans lobby groups without consulting women’s organisations or sports scientists. Those questioning the narrative are accused of transphobia – as Martina Navratilova and Nicola Adams have discovered.The most common argument used in favour of inclusion is that sport is all about natural advantage and that being a trans woman is just another factor to add to the list alongside Michael Phelps’s size 14 feet and double-jointed ankles. The problem with this argument is that we don’t compete according to foot-size, but we do protect the integrity of women’s sport because the advantage gained from male puberty is so comprehensive in terms of speed, power, strength and so much else. Phelps’s feet gave him an advantage as a swimmer; male puberty gave him a much bigger advantage across the board. At the Beijing Olympics, he won the 200m freestyle in 1.42.96, breaking the world record. Federica Pellegrini broke the women’s world record at the same distance, finishing in 1.54.82 – a time that wouldn’t have got her into the men’s semi-finals. It wasn’t internalised misogyny slowing her down. Serena Williams told David Letterman that were she to play Andy Murray, “I would lose, 6-0, 6-0, in … maybe 10 minutes”. Male puberty and androgens give an advantage in a different stratosphere. Andy Murray and Serena Williams competing in mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 2019. Williams said Murray would beat her in ‘maybe 10 minutes’ if they played against each other in singles. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PASome claim that this debate is irrelevant as trans women aren’t winning everything, which is true. The simple explanation is that the athletes who have transitioned haven’t generally been good enough. As Tucker says, the best female cyclist will beat 99% of men, but the best men are 10-15% better. And anyway, regardless of whether trans women win or not – whether Hubbard wins or not – it is legitimate to question the rules that allow them in the competition, given the retained advantage. Given the safety issues in combat, collision and some team sports. Given the hidden exclusions, those women and girls who decide that a sport now isn’t for them. And the not so hidden ones: Kuinini “Nini” Manumua, the 21-year-old Tongan who would have gone to her first Olympics if Hubbard hadn’t been selected.The American cyclist Veronica Ivy (previously known as Rachel McKinnon) says hang the heartache, trans women are women and should simply be able to self-identify themselves into the women’s category at every level. This argument has got some traction. In which case, why bother having sex categories for sport at all? Just put everyone in together and watch biological males win the lot. I’d argue the opposite. The science is young. Stop. Breathe. Trans women should be able to live their sporting lives to the fullest so if research can find a way for them to participate in female sports without advantage, brilliant. Until then, remove the idea of gender altogether and revert to sex-based categories – a female category and an open category that can cater for trans men who have taken testosterone, trans women and men.But above all, there needs to be a realisation that you can’t always have it all. Just as women and trans men can’t dominate in men’s sports; and men can’t enter women’s sport; trans women shouldn’t be able to push open a door that was locked for a reason. It isn’t fair."

Booked for diving late on. 5 Rodri Told off by Guardiola for one backwards pass than put Akanji under pressure and was never at his best. 6 Ilkay Gundogan Couple of loose passes and heavy touches in the first half set the tone for City's struggles. Had to do better with a second-half chance and then let Toney in front of him for the dramatic late winner. 4 Kevin De Bruyne Had his fair share of injury disappointment during tournament football so hard to blame him for being cautious, but bar one spell in the first half he was fairly quiet. 6 Bernardo Silva Bright down the left and almost won a penalty with one fine flick past Henry. Nimble footwork kept Brentford on their toes. 7 Phil Foden Started like he was lacking rhythm, which was understandable after his recent lack of action, but took his goal quite brilliantly. 7 Erling Haaland Have to wonder how fit he was.

The North insists leaflets and other objects flown across the border by activists spread the virus, an unscientific claim Seoul describes as “ridiculous.”North Korea has a history of dialing up pressure on the South when it doesn’t get what it wants from the United States, and there are concerns that North Korea’s threat portends a provocation, which could possibly be a nuclear or major missile test or even border skirmishes. Some experts say the North may stir up tensions around joint military exercises the United States and South Korea start next week.Yoon, a conservative who took office in May, said North Korea’s denuclearization would be key for peace in the region and the world. If North Korea halts its nuclear weapons development and genuinely commits to a process of denuclearization, the South will respond with huge economic rewards that would be provided in phases, Yoon said.Yoon’s proposal wasn’t meaningfully different from previous South Korean offers that have already been rejected by North Korea, which has been accelerating its efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles program leader Kim Jong Un sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.“We will implement a large-scale program to provide food, providing assistance for establishing infrastructure for the production, transmission and distribution of electrical power, and carry out projects to modernize ports and airports to facilitate trade,” Yoon said.“We will also help improve North Korea’s agricultural production, provide assistance to modernize its hospitals and medical infrastructure, and carry out initiatives to allow for international investment and financial support,” he added, insisting that such programs would “significantly” improve North Korean lives.Inter-Korean ties have deteriorated amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang, which derailed in early 2019 over disagreements in exchanging a release of crippling U.S.-led sanctions against the North and the North’s disarmament steps.North Korea has ramped up its testing activity in 2022, launching more than 30 ballistic missiles so far, including its first demonstrations of intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017. Experts say Kim is intent on exploiting a favorable environment to push forward his weapons program, with the U.N. Security Council divided and effectively paralyzed over Russia’s war on Ukraine.North Korea’s unusually fast pace in weapons demonstrations also underscore brinkmanship aimed at forcing Washington to accept the idea of North Korea as a nuclear power and negotiating badly economic benefits and security concessions from a position of strength, experts say. The U.S. and South Korean governments have also said the North is gearing up to conduct its first nuclear test since September 2017, when it claimed to have detonated a nuclear warhead designed for its ICBMs.In face of growing North Korean threats, Yoon has vowed to bolster South Korea’s defense in conjunction with its alliance with the United States and also strengthen security ties with Japan, which is also alarmed by the North’s nuclear and ballistic weapons program.South Korea’s relations with Japan declined to post-war lows over the past several years as the countries allowed their grievances over history to extend to other areas including trade and military cooperation.While Yoon has called for future-oriented cooperation with Japan, history may continue to pose an obstacle to relations. The countries have struggled to negotiate a solution after Japanese companies rejected South Korean court rulings in recent years to compensate South Koreans who were subject to wartime industrial slavery, an issue that could cause further diplomatic rupture if it results in the forced sales of the companies’ local assets.“In the past, we had to unshackle ourselves from Imperial Japan’s political control and defend our freedom. Today, Japan is our partner as we face common threats that challenge the freedom of global citizens,” Yoon said. “When South Korea and Japan move toward a common future and when the mission of our times align, based on our shared universal values, it will also help us solve the historical problems that exist between our two countries.”While Washington has said it would push for additional sanctions if North Korea conducts another nuclear test, the prospects for meaningful punitive measures are unclear. China and Russia recently vetoed U.S.-sponsored resolutions at the U.N. Security Council that would have increased sanctions on the North over its ballistic missile testing this year.North Korea’s state media said Monday that Kim exchanged messages with Russian President Vladimir Putin and celebrated their strengthening ties.Kim said the countries’ relations were forged by the Soviet contributions in Japan’s World War II defeat and that they were strengthening their “strategic and tactical cooperation and support and solidarity” in the face of enemies’ military threats. Putin said closer ties between the countries would help bring stability to the region, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said.North Korea has repeatedly blamed the United States for the crisis in Ukraine, claiming the West’s “hegemonic policy” justified Russia’s offensive in Ukraine to protect itself."

Unfortunately, the state of the movie industry being what it is right now, that isn't possible and we all have to wait until next year to see Michael Myers back at it again. But Blumhouse Productions head Jason Blum has promised that, come hell or high water, the upcoming entry in the franchise is coming out next October. During a recent interview for the Welcome to the Blumhouse series and The Craft: Legacy, Jason Blum, who serves as a key producer on Halloween Kills, was asked about a further delay, possibly to 2022. Given the uncertain nature of the world currently, it is a reasonable question. Be that as it may, Blum did not mince words in his response. Here's what he had to say about it. RELATED: John Carpenter Praises Halloween Kills as the 'Quintessential Slasher Film' ""No [laughs]. If this is still going on next Halloween? No, we're not holding it. Halloween Kills is coming out next October come hell or high water, vaccine or no vaccine. It is coming out."" So there you have it. Michael Myers will be back in Haddonfield mixing it up with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. As we've seen recently, moviegoers are, by and large, still hesitant to go to theaters right now. Tenet and The New Mutants did not draw big crowds and what few movies are available are not tempting enough to get most people to take on the risk. It is believed that traditional theaters will not be completely safe until a vaccine is widely available. In the meantime, drive-ins have become a haven for lovers of the cinematic experience.  To that point, there is no telling what the movie industry is going to look like come Halloween 2021. Halloween Kills is coming out next year, Jason Blum is making that quite clear, but that doesn't mean the distribution strategy won't change. 2018's Halloween earned $255 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing slasher in history. It would greatly benefit Universal Pictures and Blumhouse to give the sequel a wide release in as many theaters as possible. But if that isn't feasible, they may have to get creative doing some sort of premium VOD release or something along those lines. But a lot can happen in a year. David Gordon Green is returning to the director's chair for the sequel. Franchise creator John Carpenter is also on board as an executive producer, in addition to doing the score. Carpenter recently called it, ""the quintessential slasher film."" Halloween Kills is currently set to hit theaters on October 15, 2021. Another sequel that will bring this version of the franchise to a close, titled Halloween Ends, is also planned. It is currently scheduled to arrive in October 2022. But meeting that date that will be dependent on getting production squared away by then. We'll be sure to keep you posted as any further details are made available. This news comes to us via Forbes.

Also, nearly 80% of the total new cases have been reported from 90 districts, official data show indicating the second wave is now limited to certain areas needing focused measures and intensive restrictions to control further spread. Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Kerala and Meghalaya are the top five states having maximum number of districts with above 10% test positivity. The northeastern states together also account for 47 districts with high positivity rate. “The second wave has come down in most states. However, some states are still in the midst of the second wave. This heterogeneity, in the large country that we have, has to be appreciated and district specific measures should continue to be guided by test positivity rate,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said. Apart from the 73 districts with above 10% positivity, 65 districts have positivity ranging between 5-10% and rest 595 have below 5% positivity. The overall caseload of active cases have dropped to below 5 lakh cases with only 91 districts now reporting more than 100 cases daily, down from 262 districts in the beginning of June and 531 in the start of May. With average daily tests at 18.30 lakh, the weekly positivity rate now stands at 2.7%. The Centre emphasised on the need for aggressive testing, particularly in states with large number of districts with high test positivity and fresh Covid-19 cases. “Testing has played a key role in our fight against the pandemic and it has to continue. Currently, we are doing 1,400 tests per million, which is 10 times the recommendations of the WHO, but we should continue because during the second wave, much of our public health response was guided by test positivity rate and that really helped us bring this wave down very fast,” Bhargava said.

It offers fairly traditional fare, but rugby fans flock in their droves and the atmosphere is hard to top: you'll find plenty of high spirits and match chats. There's often live music, too.  171 North End Rd, Fulham, W14 9NL Better looking than the usual sports bars, the Famous Three Kings boasts 16 screens and, though they're known for favouring the Welsh, they'll be screening every match of the tournament.  45 Kew Rd, Richmond, TW9 2NQ Scottish pubs are few and far between in the capital, so your best bet is to find an area where you're likely to bump into like-minded fans. The Orange Tree has two drop down screens inside, and a 65"" screen for those who fancy braving the outside patio terrace. They're big on food here, too, so make a day of it and eat. If you haven't been, be sure to see what's on at the Orange Tree Theatre next door, too.  19 Perth Rd, N4 3HB No prizes for guessing where this pub's allegiance lies, wandering into it's couldn't-be-more-Irish decor. Plenty of decent ales on tap, a surprising amount of space given how cosy it all feels, and a menu offering up Thai food for those who fancy it. And, with the likes of guitars, scarves, accordions and aeroplanes hanging from the ceiling, you can always play eye-spy, if the match is proving to be especially uneventful.  22 Frith St, W1D 4RF Another Soho favourite, this 24-hour cafe has long been a thriving hub, but it really packs out when Italy have a sporting fixture. The place may be a little too small to really watch the entire game, unless there are just a couple of you, but it's the go-to if you're wheeling around Soho and want to check in on the score. They do a decent coffee too, so it's always worth a visit between pubs whether you're paying any attention to the match or not.  226 Shoreditch High St, E1 6PJ Six screens will have every drop, tackle, scrum, maul and try in vivid detail as they show every single Six Nations match, with their food truck on hand to keep energy levels up. Naturally, there's plenty of craft beer kicking around in this east London hangout.  Greenwood, 170 Victoria Street, SW1E 5LB Victoria sports bar Greenwood is going all out for the Six Nations this year. As well as showing on their big screens downstairs, the bar is also hosting a luxurious Guinness lounge, where fans can enjoy a ‘stadium atmosphere’ and VIPs are served by their own personal bartender. If fans feel like enjoying an even more exclusive experience, the venue is offering the chance to enjoy lunch with rugby legends including Andy Goode, Stephen Ferris, Andy Powell and Jim Hamilton.  Ewan Munro  England open their account against France on Sunday, with the game kicking off at 3pm inside the Stade de France.  Our top pick:   This fantastic Irish bar from duo Aaron Wall and Ciarán Smith has some of the best Guinness in the city, and an exceptional cocktail menu to boot.

Although most of BC’s residents live “down south” within a few hours of the U.S. border, the province extends more than 2,000 kilometres north. With majestic scenery and abundant natural beauty, exploring this picturesque region is perfectly suited for those who enjoy epic road trips — especially when the reward at the end of a long day of driving is a craft brewery serving up delicious beer. From Prince Rupert on the west coast, connected to Vancouver Island by the BC Ferries Inside Passage route, across the province to Valemount near Jasper on the Alberta border, and northeast up to Fort St. John in the Peace Country, 12 craft breweries await discovery on the Northern BC Ale Trail, each one celebrating local history, geography and culture in its own unique way. The western leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail begins in Prince Rupert where the nautically themed Wheelhouse Brewing embraces that community’s connection to the ocean. In nearby Terrace, Sherwood Mountain Brewhouse’s patio is always packed with folks enjoying that inland community’s abundance of sunshine. Smithers, a few hours east, has two craft breweries, Bulkley Valley Brewery and Smithers Brewing, both of which embrace the region’s many outdoor activities: skiing, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing. Then there is Ursa Minor Brewing, which is based on Little Bear Ranch, a 540-acre cattle farm about 100km south of Burns Lake. This side trip involves crossing François Lake by ferry and driving on some dirt roads so be sure to plan ahead and check the brewery’s hours.  Smithers has two craft breweries, Smithers Brewing and Bulkley Valley Brewery, both embracing the region’s many outdoor activities: skiing, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing.  Prince George is the largest city in Northern BC, so it makes sense that all the northern breweries converge there annually for the Kiwanis AleFest. P.G. is also home to Crossroads Brewing & Distillery and Trench Brewing & Distilling, and there’s even a third brewery in the works there. The eastern leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail starts in Fort St. John where you can taste the range of beers available at Beard’s Brewing and Mighty Peace Brewing, both of which love working with local farmers to include local ingredients in their recipes.  The eastern leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail starts in Fort St. John, where you can taste the range of beers available at Mighty Peace Brewing and Beard’s Brewing, both working with farmers to include local ingredients in their recipes.  Then return south to visit Barkerville Brewing on the Gold Rush Trail in Quesnel — the brewery is named for the historic town nearby where you can see what life was like during the Gold Rush. All I know is it’s definitely better with craft beer! Next is Fox Mountain Brewing in Williams Lake, a great spot for both food and beer. Finally, head east to Valemount, home of Three Ranges Brewing, a pioneer operation that helped bring awareness of craft beer to the North and has been slaking the thirst of local residents for several years already.

Under the order's conditions, renters must sign a declaration that they make less than $99,000 a year, or twice that amount if filing a joint tax return.The order ""does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract,"" according to the CDC's order.Landlords can continue to collect ""fees, penalties or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract,"" according to the order.The order expires on 31 December.As many as 40m people in the US could be at risk of eviction, according to the Aspen Institute, while nearly half of all renters in the US are cost-burdened, or paying more than 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.Protests across the US led by renters, tenant organisations and housing groups have demanded local and federal governments ""cancel rent"" and extend eviction moratoriums.""A uniform, national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent is long overdue and badly needed,"" the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement. ""The very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won't lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration's action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.""The organisation said that while the""eviction moratorium is an essential step,"" it is merely a ""half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,"" according to the organisation.""This action delays but does not prevent evictions,"" the statement said.The order follows a series of executive orders from Donald Trump, sidestepping Congress after it failed to extend federal unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, as locally issued moratoriums on eviction proceedings were lifted and courts reopened their dockets.But the president's order did not immediately halt evictions, despite his emphatic claims last month that renters are ""not going to be evicted"" because of his order.""We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen,"" he said last month. ""We're not going to evict people ... We are not letting people be evicted.""His order, signed on 8 August, directed federal agencies to ""consider"" whether halting evictions are necessary as a health precaution during the pandemic.House Democrats passed two measures with up to $100 billion for rental assistance, but the Republican-dominated Senate has not agreed to take up the legislation.The National Low Income Housing Coalition has urged the president to work with Congress to put in place a national moratorium on all evictions with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and housing vouchers, and another $11.5 billion for emergency resources for people experiencing homelessness.""Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression,"" the organisation's president Diane Yentel said. ""Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless."""

Playing without All-Star slugger Aaron Judge and five of his teammates who also tested positive for COVID-19 recently, the Yankees won their second straight against rival Boston after dropping the first seven meetings this year. New York won two of three in a series originally set for four games before Thursday’s scheduled opener was postponed for testing and contact tracing. Boston, which has lost six of eight, left town with a half-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay, and seven in front of the fourth-place Yankees. Taillon (5-4) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings of four-hit ball in his 100th major league start, improving to 4-0 in his past five outings. Chad Green escaped a jam in the sixth to protect a three-run cushion.   Ryan LaMarre, just called up from the minors, added a two-run homer in the eighth — his first with the Yankees and first in the majors since September 2019. DJ LeMahieu extended his on-base streak to 30 games, longest in the big leagues this season, with a single that set up a third-inning run. New York’s no-name outfield of LaMarre, Greg Allen and Trey Amburgey began the night with 12 career home runs — fewest for a Bronx Bombers starting outfield trio since June 10, 1991. Not exactly Mantle, Maris and Berra — but not a problem on this night. Torres hit his fifth homer on an 0-2 pitch from Martín Pérez (7-6) leading off the second. Torres also homered his last time up Saturday night in a 3-1 victory that was called after six innings because of heavy rain. That gave him long balls in consecutive games for the first time since a three-game streak in June 2019. Odor reached on a bunt single leading off the fifth and scored on Greg Allen’s sacrifice fly. He added a two-run homer in the seventh to make it 5-0. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: 1B Christian Arroyo strained his left hamstring in the third when he went into a split stretching for a throw. He was replaced by Bobby Dalbec. It was the first career appearance at first base for Arroyo, who has played all the other infield positions. Before the game, manager Alex Cora said Arroyo had earned more playing time, and he and the team were comfortable with him at first base. … OF/1B Danny Santana (left quadriceps strain) is expected to come off the injured list Monday after finishing a rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Worcester. … All-Star SS Xander Bogaerts doubled twice after sitting out Saturday night with a sore left wrist. He was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth with Boston trailing 7-0. Yankees: RHP Luis Severino threw 30 pitches to hitters, simulating two innings. “I thought he threw the ball really well. Looks strong, healthy,” manager Aaron Boone said. Severino will likely face hitters again in five or six days before potentially beginning a minor league rehab assignment. He hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery, and his return was slowed because of a groin injured sustained June 12 in a rehab appearance. … Boone said RHP Darren O’Day’s season is likely over due to a left hamstring injury. … Boone said all six Yankees players who recently tested positive for the coronavirus are doing pretty well as far as symptoms are concerned. RHP Jonathan Loaisiga, one of those players on the COVID-19 injured list, was expected to fly to New York and rejoin the team by Tuesday, according to Boone. … RHP Michael King (bruised right middle finger) still feels discomfort and won’t throw for another five to seven days. … Amburgey exited after four innings with a right hamstring cramp and was replaced in the lineup by Brett Gardner. … A leaping LaMarre hit the right field wall with a loud thud trying to catch Christian Vázquez’s fifth-inning double and was shaken up. LaMarre was checked by Boone and two athletic trainers, but remained in the game. LaMarre was called up from Triple-A before the game to replace OF Tim Locastro, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a torn right ACL. UP NEXT Red Sox: Shuffle off to Buffalo for the opener of a three-game series Monday night against the division-rival Blue Jays. RHP Nick Pivetta (7-4, 4.30 ERA) faces Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (3-5, 4.34). Yankees: Following an off day, RHP Domingo Germán (4-5, 4.72 ERA) starts Tuesday night at home against Philadelphia RHP Aaron Nola (6-5, 4.53) in the opener of a two-game interleague series.

Ms Levitt’s report documents a company focused on keeping prices low and getting new products to market quickly.                                                                                                                                                   By keeping large parts of its supply chain in the UK – 40% of its clothes are made here, especially in Leicester – Boohoo can prioritise speed, getting new products to market in as little as 48 hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Its speed and agility has made Boohoo a major player in the fashion world, and made it worth over 2.5 times more than Marks & Spencer.                                                                                                                                                   But while Boohoo’s Leicester suppliers were knocking out new dresses at incredible speed and at low price, they were meant to be overseen by a compliance team.                                                                                                                                                   However, Ms Levitt said only one person worked on the compliance “team”, having perhaps 500 suppliers and subcontractors to check.                                                                                                                                                                   Even this figure is unclear, as Boohoo was never able to give the lawyer a list of all the companies involved in making its clothes in Leicester.                                                                                                                                                   Regardless, it was “too much for one person”, one insider told investigators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The insider, who was appointed in 2017, said he had asked repeatedly for additional help and thought the task was so big he needed two other full-time colleagues working in the city.                                                                                                                                                                   Ms Levitt said: “In late 2018, he had suggested to members of the Boohoo Board that outside independent auditors should be engaged to audit both suppliers and subcontractors, but nothing happened.”                                                                                                                                                   The difficulty of keeping an eye on the Leicester factories became obvious in August this year when auditors from Verisio did a spot check: “Ten people left through a fire exit as the auditors entered the premises,” Ms Levitt said.                                                                                                                                                   At another site 40% of the workforce left during the audit.                                                                                                                                                                   The auditors found a majority of suppliers they visited did not comply with rules over employment documentation, records of working hours, minimum wage, health and safety, and Covid-19 controls, while nearly half fell short on payment practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Many workers were not getting statutory holiday pay, and one employee claimed they were being paid £3 per hour.                                                                                                                                                   One factory’s managing director admitted workers were getting minimum wage. He explained that staff wanted to claim benefits so he was under pressure to pay less than minimum wage, and they would leave if he paid them more.                                                                                                                                                                   One factory had a locked fire door, another provided no toilet paper for staff and in one place there was no “wholesome drinking water”.                                                                                                                                                            Today we are setting out the further steps we are taking to drive long-lasting and meaningful change that all stakeholders in the Boohoo group will benefit from.            John Lyttle                                                                                           Auditors found some form of non-compliance of varying seriousness at all of Boohoo’s top 20 biggest suppliers.

On December 11 the managing director of Verisio wrote an email that was forwarded to chief executive Mr Lyttle later that evening.                                                                                                                                                   “The factory has the worst working conditions that I have seen in the UK and is not safe for the workers,” the email read.                                                                                                                                                   “The risk is so high to the Boohoo brand and is a major news story waiting to happen.”                                                                                                                                                   A few days later Boohoo’s director of sustainability Tom Kershaw went to see the factories in question with Mr Lyttle and one other Boohoo staff member.

Speaking to investigators, Mr Kamani said: “The way we treat our people is our responsibility. But if we’re subsequently getting so many garments made in Leicester and there is maybe 20,000 or 30,000 machinists, is that my responsibility? If they then eat too many chapatis and become obese, is that then my responsibility?”                                                                                                                                                   Boohoo said on Friday it was taking steps to improve its processes after taking extensive feedback from Ms Levitt.                                                                                                                                                   “Today we are setting out the further steps we are taking to drive long-lasting and meaningful change that all stakeholders in the Boohoo group will benefit from,” said Mr Lyttle.                                                                                                                                                   Investment advisors PIRC said: “Directors knew in late 2019 that there were very serious issues regarding the treatment of factory workers in Leicester​ and this has been an open secret in the industry for longer. We would expect those directors responsible to consider their positions.”                                                                                                                                                                             PA                                   "

The main rotor hub strap pins in certain Bell 212, 204B and 205 series helicopters must be inspected and replaced, Transport Canada said in an emergency airworthiness directive issued Monday.  The notice warns that the pins can fail, resulting in the rotor head and blade separating from the aircraft mid-flight.  ""Failure of a main rotor hub strap pin will result in detachment of the main rotor blade and loss of control of the helicopter,"" the directive says.  Serial numbers on the rotor hub strap pins in the affected Bell helicopters must be checked against a list in the airworthiness directive before they can fly again, Transport Canada said.  ""During investigation of a recent Bell 212 helicopter fatal accident in Canada, it has been discovered that one of the outboard main rotor hub strap pin[s] … sheared off during flight, leading to detachment of the main rotor blade and the main rotor head.""  A spokesperson for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada told CBC News the Transport Canada notice was triggered by the TSB's investigation into the fatal June 28 crash of a Bell 212 near Evansburg, Alta.  Pilot Heath Coleman, 48, of Prince George, B.C., died as he worked to battle a wildfire.  Coleman was alone when the helicopter he was flying crashed in a rural area near the fire front.     The failed part had accumulated only 20 hours of service, the notice from Transport Canada said. It said an inspection of another Canadian Bell 212 found a main rotor hub strap pin ""deformed"" after about 29 hours in service.   The cause of the part failure has not been determined, Transport Canada said.   Coleman was flying solo in a Bell 212 helicopter similar to this one when he died in a crash June 28 west of Edmonton. (Yellowhead Helicopters)  Bell Helicopters issued a ""removal of service advisory"" on the defective parts late Monday.   The company said some of the main rotor hub strap pins ""may not have been manufactured in accordance with the engineering design requirements.""   Bell is requiring that records be checked before the next flight and that any defective parts be replaced. The company said the work on each aircraft could take 20 hours to complete.  A Bell spokesperson said company officials could not discuss details due to the ongoing crash investigation but offered condolences to the Coleman family.      If you lose the rotor blades, it's equivalent to an airplane losing its wings.-Jon Lee, TSB    Jon Lee, the TSB's manager of regional operations for Western Canada, said there were obvious signs at the crash site that the rotor pin had failed.  The rotor blades were not with the helicopter wreckage.   ""To us as investigators, that's a very obvious first signal that something happened in-flight rather than as a result of hitting the ground,"" Lee said in an interview Tuesday.  One blade was found 23 metres from the crash site. The other was found on the second day of the investigation, 46 metres from the site.  ""When we were able to recover the rotor blades, we were able to observe that this retention pin had sheared,"" Lee said.  The parts are being examined at the TSB lab.  'Gravity takes over'  Lee said the crash was not survivable.  ""Essentially, with a helicopter, if you lose the rotor blades, it's equivalent to an airplane losing its wings,"" Lee said.  ""You've lost all ability to maintain lift and gravity takes over.""  The 175-hectare wildfire near Evansburg has been burning since June 22 when it triggered a temporary evacuation of nearby homes. It is now classified as under control.  'Something catastrophic happened'  Coleman was a longtime employee of Yellowhead Helicopters.  Company CEO Jacob Forman said Coleman was flying to pick up firefighters in a swamp near the fire.  Forman, who went to the scene, told CBC News his crew helped locate the second missing blade.  ""It seemed like the critical piece of evidence that was going to be needed,"" he said.   Forman said he never thought pilot error could be to blame. Coleman was a talented and deeply trusted member of his team for nearly a decade.  ""Something catastrophic happened ... he didn't have a chance."""

REUTERS/Eloisa Lopez  Millions have taken to Hong Kong streets in anti-government protests that have intensified since mid-June, at times forcing banks, stores, shopping malls, restaurants and even government buildings to close as the demonstrations degenerated into violent clashes between police and activists.  Hong Kong’s flagship airline, Cathay Pacific, said on Wednesday the protests reduced inbound passenger traffic in July and travelers were weighing on forward bookings, as it reported it swung to a half-year profit.  Thousands of protesters descended on the Chinese-ruled city’s airport in July, where some chanted “free Hong Kong” and others handed out flyers explaining the city’s crisis to tourists.  Protesters plan to rally at the airport again this weekend, potentially causing further disruptions after a strike on Monday saw more than 200 flights canceled.  The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd (  0045.HK  ), owner of the opulent Peninsula hotel in the bustling shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui, said it too was worried about the impact of the protests on tourist arrivals as well as the broader economy.  “We are concerned about the effect this political uncertainty may have on our results, especially given the proportion of our income which is earned in Hong Kong,” said Clement Kwok, CEO of the hotel group, in an earnings statement on Wednesday.  What started as an angry response to a now-suspended extradition bill, which would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial, now includes demands for greater democracy and the resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.  Hong Kong retail sales, a key part of the city’s economy, felt a growing impact in June from the mass protests, falling 6.7% from a year earlier in the biggest decline since February.  Many businesses in Hong Kong are already facing strains from China’s economic slowdown, a weak Chinese yuan and fallout from the Sino-U.S. trade war.  Tourism to Hong Kong, especially from mainland China, has dropped markedly, weighing on hotel occupancy rates. Britain, Japan, Singapore and Australia have issued travel alerts following the violent protests.  Reporting By Anne Marie Roantree and Donny Kwok; editing by Gopakumar Warrier  "

August 2020. Die ERWE Immobilien AG (ISIN DE000A1X3WX6, WKN: A1X3WX), Frankfurt am Main, hat die Büroflächen in ihrem Bestandsobjekt in der Krefelder Innenstadt an die Stadt Krefeld vermietet. Die Stadt hat die rund 3.400 qm Büroflächen in dem Bürohaus in der St. Anton Straße auf zunächst zehn Jahre angemietet, um dort Behördenbereiche unterzubringen. Der Vertrag beinhaltet die Option auf eine Verlängerung um fünf Jahre. Nach einem entsprechenden politischen Beschluss wurde der Mietvertrag jetzt unterzeichnet. ""Wir freuen uns, dass wir einem Teil der Mitarbeiter der Stadt Krefeld ein neues Zuhause geben dürfen"", sagt Rüdiger Weitzel, Vorstand der ERWE Immobilien AG. ""damit verfolgen wir konsequent unseren Ansatz weiter, Immobilien in guter Lage, die vormals von Retailnutzungen dominiert wurden, in gemischt genutzte Objekte zu überführen. Hiermit leisten wir einen wichtigen Beitrag zur notwendigen Belebung unserer Innenstädte"", so Weitzel weiter. ""Nach genauer Prüfung hat sich die Stadt entschlossen, das attraktive Angebot der ERWE für eine langfristige Nutzung anzunehmen"", sagt Rachid Jaghou, Betriebsleiter Zentrales Gebäudemanagement Krefeld.

جنوب سودانية، وستتناول مناقشة مختلف الملفات المتعلقة بالتعاون المشترك بين البلدين وسبل تعزيز العلاقات الثنائية، خاصةً على الصعيد الاقتصادي والتنموي، بما يسهم في تحقيق مصالح البلدين الشقيقين وذلك في اطار الإرادة القوية المتبادلة لتعزيز أطر التعاون بينهما.من جانبها، ذكرت صحيفة ""الشرق الأوسط"": ""أبلغ رئيس الوزراء الإثيوبي آبي أحمد أمس، الجمعة، موفدي الاتحاد الأفريقي عزمه على مواصلة العمليات العسكرية في منطقة تيجراي في شمال إثيوبيا""، رافضًا دعوات الحوار، في وقت يستعد جيشه للمرحلة الأخيرة من الهجوم على قوات الإقليم الشمالي.ومنذ أكثر من ثلاثة أسابيع يخوض الجانبان معارك عنيفة في تيجراي، حيث قالت مجموعة الأزمات الدولية إنها أوقعت آلاف القتلى «بينهم مدنيون كثر وقوات أمن»، وتسود المخاوف حول مصير نصف مليون شخص يقطنون ميكيلي، عاصمة إقليم تيجراي، التي يقول الجيش إنه يحاصرها ويهدد بمهاجمتها.وحذر قادة دوليون ومنظمات حقوقية من أن هجوما كهذا سيشكل خرقا لقواعد الحرب، داعين إلى وساطة عاجلة، حسبما نقلت وكالة الصحافة الفرنسية.كما قالت صحيفة ""الشرق الأوسط""، إن إيران أعلنت أمس، اغتيال عالمها النووي محسن فخري زاده، الذي يوصف بأنه «الصندوق الأسود» لبرنامج التسلح النووي الإيراني، في كمين قرب طهران التي سارعت إلى توجيه أصابع الاتهام إلى إسرائيل وهددتها بـ«انتقام قاسٍ».وذكرت وزارة الدفاع الإيرانية في بيان أن هجومًا استهدف رئيس منظمة البحث والتطوير التابعة لها محسن فخري زاده، ما أدى إلى وفاته بعد إصابته «بجروح خطرة»، على يد من وصفتهم بـ«عناصر إرهابية».وأوضحت وكالتا «تسنيم» و«فارس» التابعتان لـ«الحرس الثوري» أن عميلة الاغتيال جرت في بلدة أبسرد قرب مدينة دماوند الواقعة شرق طهران.وتحدثت عن «تفجير» قبل «إطلاق النار على سيارة» فخري زاده، وورد أن ثلاثة إلى أربعة أشخاص آخرين قتلوا في تبادل لإطلاق النار.وفيما لم تعلق إسرائيل رسميًا فإن رئيس الوزراء، بنيامين نتنياهو، سارع للظهور في شريط مصور من بيته حال كشف اغتيال فخري زاده، وقال: «لا أستطيع الإعلان عن كل إنجازاتي هذا الأسبوع، لكنها كثيرة».‏ونقلت صحيفة «نيويورك تايمز» عن مسئول أمريكي مع اثنين من مسئولي المخابرات أن «إسرائيل كانت وراء الهجوم على العالم»، ولم يتضح ما إذا كانت الولايات المتحدة على علم بالعملية مسبقا.كما ذكرت صحيفة ""الشرق الأوسط"" أن أكثر من 400 ألف وفاة تم تسجيلهم في أوروبا بمرض «كوفيد-19» الناجم عن فيسروس كورونا المستجد، وأوروبا هي ثانية أكثر مناطق العالم تسجيلا للوفيات بسبب الجائحة مع 400 ألف و649 وفاة من أصل 17 مليونًا و606 آلاف و370 إصابة، بعد منطقة أميركا اللاتينية والكاريبي التي سجلت 444 ألفًا و26 حالة وفاة من أصل 12 مليونًا و825 ألفًا و500 إصابة.وكشف المدير العام لمنظمة الصحة العالمية، تيدروس أدهانوم غيبريسوس، أمس، أن نحو نصف عدد إصابات ووفيات «كورونا» سجلت في 4 دول. وقال غيبريسوس، إن الوباء أثر في جميع دول العالم، لكن تأثيره لم يكن متساويًا.وأضاف المدير العام للمنظمة الأممية، في تغريدات على «تويتر»، أن نحو 70 في المائة من إجمالي الإصابات والوفيات سجلت في 10 دول لم يحددها.في غضون ذلك، أعلنت الحكومة البريطانية، أمس، أنها طلبت من هيئة تنظيم الأدوية لديها أن تُقيّم لقاح فيروس «كوفيد - 19»، الذي تطوّره شركة «أسترا زينيكا» البريطانية، بالتعاون مع جامعة أكسفورد، وذلك استعدادًا لطرحه في السوق.جاء ذلك الإعلان بالتزامن مع ما كشفه مصدران مطلعان لوكالة «رويترز»، من أن متسللين مشتبهين من كوريا الشمالية حاولوا اختراق نُظم شركة «أسترا زينيكا» خلال الأسابيع الأخيرة، في الوقت الذي تخوض فيه الشركة سباقًا بالاشتراك مع جامعة أكسفورد لطرح لقاحها ضد «كوفيد - 19» في الأسواق. وذكرت ""الشرق الأوسط"": ""رفضت محكمة استئناف اتحادية في الولايات المتحدة، طلبًا قدمته حملة الرئيس دونالد ترمب لحجب إعلان الرئيس المنتخب جو بايدن فائزًا بالتصويت في ولاية بنسلفانيا الحاسمة"".ويعد الحكم انتكاسة كبيرة أخرى لجهود ترامب الرامية لقلب نتيجة الانتخابات التي جرت في الثالث من نوفمبر، وكانت بنسلفانيا اعتمدت في وقت سابق فوز بايدن.من جانبها، قالت صحيفة ""عكاظ"" إن التليفزيون الرسمي الإيراني أعلن أمس، الجمعة، مقتل أبرز العلماء النوويين البارزين الإيرانيين في المجال الصاروخي محسن فخري زادة في منطقة قرب طهران، في عملية اغتيال نفذت بتفجير أعقبه إطلاق نار.ويعد زادة أحد قادة الحرس الثوري الإيراني، ومن الشخصيات المدرجة في قائمة عقوبات مجلس الأمن الدولي، وكان تقرير قديم للرقابة النووية التابعة للأمم المتحدة، عرف محسن فخري زاده على أنه شخصية رئيسية في العمل الإيراني المشتبه به لتطوير التكنولوجيا والمهارات اللازمة لصنع القنابل الذرية، فيما وصفه نوويون غربيون بـ «الرجل العسكري الغامض» الذي يدير الأنشطة النووية الإيرانية.وذكر اسم زاده في حديث رئيس الوزراء الإسرائيلي بينيامين نتنياهو عام 2018، بعد استيلاء الاستخبارات الإسرائيلية على حزمة واسعة من الوثائق المتعلقة بمساعي طهران لتطوير ترسانة نووية.

But treatment plants also need the gas to purify water.,wired.com,"Tampa Bay Water’s liquid oxygen supply has been reduced by about half, Moore says. So they’re diverting the oxygen they’ve got to the treatment plant to sufficiently disinfect the water, since they can’t alter that process. They can, however, substitute sodium hypochlorite, also known as bleach, for ozone at the plant that gets rid of the hydrogen sulfide. But given the crunch, the utility is asking customers to cut back on water use, like watering lawns and washing cars. “In this scenario, the less water needed for demand means less water to treat,” says Moore. But, he adds, “it's very important that residents know that the quality of the drinking water remains safe.” At the same time, it’s very important that Covid patients get the supplemental oxygen they need. Covid-19 brutalizes the lungs, interfering with the transfer of oxygen from the air into the bloodstream, which is needed to keep the heart, brain, and other vital organs working properly. The target oxygen saturation for the blood is above 92 percent—get below 90 percent and you start feeling shortness of breath. (At the hospital, they measure this by slipping a device called a pulse oximeter over a patient’s finger, which fires beams of light to noninvasively measure the oxygen in their blood.) Once saturation drops below 90 percent, doctors should put a Covid-19 patient on supplemental oxygen, advises the Centers for Disease Control.But if only it were that simple with Covid, which plays a nasty trick on the human body. “Getting decreased oxygenation because of lung injury is not surprising,” says Nona Sotoodehnia, a cardiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “What is surprising in Covid is the degree to which people aren't uncomfortable with this critically-low oxygen they have.”Sotoodehnia’s research shows that just 10 percent of Covid patients presenting to the emergency room experience shortness of breath. They aren’t necessarily asymptomatic—other problems like fatigue, fever, and coughing cause them to seek help. But without shortness of breath, these patients had no way of knowing that their blood oxygen levels may have actually plummeted. In other words, they likely needed to be on supplemental oxygen long before they showed up at a hospital."

But paying off ANC salaries with the IMF loan is a major red flag...,thesouthafrican.com,"                                  Tito Mboweni has landed himself in hot water with the opposition on Friday, after he claimed that the multi-billion dollar IMF loan granted to South Africa for COVID-19 relief purposes could also contribute towards ANC salaries.    Tito Mboweni ‘could spend IMF loan on ANC salaries’    The response, submitted for a Parliamentary question fielded by the DA, stated that salary payments could be supplemented by the ‘loan disbursements’. The ANC has failed to pay their workers for several months in this calendar year, and it seems the finance minister is eyeing an escape route through the IMF:    “The loan receipts (or disbursements) will form part of the National Revenue Fund to be used to support existing government programmes, which could include salary payments.”Tito Mboweni    What was South Africa’s IMF loan meant for?    However, this could prove to be quite problematic. The IMF loan was meant to be used for the following pursuits:    The support health and frontline services.Solving the balance of payments problems caused by the pandemic.The protection of the vulnerable.Support for economic reform and job creation.Stabilising the public debt was also listed as a priority.    Plans to pay-off ANC salaries branded “a failure”    Leon Schreiber is the Shadow Minister for Public Service and Administration. He’s outraged that Mboweni has ‘failed to stand up’ to his colleagues, and claims his opposite number has now ‘reneged’ on the terms of the IMF loan.    “It is now public knowledge that his economic reform crusade has been rejected outright by his Cabinet colleagues who have repeatedly shown a willingness to send South Africa over the fiscal cliff through unrestrained spending.”“By admitting that the IMF loan could be used to pay salaries, Mboweni has reneged on the spending commitments he made in his Letter of Intent to obtain financial support under the IMF’s emergency financing instrument. The LOI committed the government to use IMF emergency assistance for things like supporting health and frontline services.”“Tito Mboweni’s failure to hold the line and defend the public purse from marauding political interests in his own party will have far-reaching consequences on South Africa’s long term fiscal stability.”Leon Schreiber                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "

Her parents contest she was struck and knocked down by the Flames assistant coach. In the video, the coach’s arm is obscured by another coach.  Craig Janzen, Brooklyn’s father, said the she explained to him “that she felt him hit her in the chest area with what she thought was his hand and felt his fingers push into her throat”.  Vanessa Janzen, Brooklyn’s mother, previously told the  Times  that Clarington coaches told tournament organizers Brooklyn was shaking hands aggressively, so the coach in question was going to stand his ground when she bumped fists with him. When she hit his hand, her hand bounced back and knocked her off balance.  After an investigation by Robert Morris University campus police, where the game took place, Jonathan Potts, the university’s vice-president of public relations and marketing, said the charge had been filed and the case has been turned over to Allegheny County district court.  Potts wouldn’t reveal details from the investigation, but did add harassment is a “summary charge,” the lowest level of criminal charge in Pennsylvania. A guilty plea would bring a fine, he said.  After the incident, which was caught on video, Durham police was informed and details were turned over to the service’s professional standards branch for an investigation.  Const. George Tudos, media officer with Durham Region police, said there are no updates on the investigation. Police wouldn’t reveal the officer’s name.  Craig said he was thankful the off-duty officer was charged.  “Although it doesn't seem like a charge that fits the crime, the definition of harassment does include assault,” he said, adding that his daughter and the team have seemed to move past the incident.  “Brooklyn is a tough kid emotionally and physically, and with the support of her teammates and coaches she has done her best to work through the fears.”  Janzen noted he isn’t sure what will sprout from the incident, but hope it sends a message that coaches need to be held accountable for their actions and “make sure coaches like this have no place in sports”.  Emails to OWHA president and CEO Fran Rider and Clarington Girls Hockey Association president Cyndy Bonello about the officer’s status as coach went unanswered.  “Most importantly, we want to be sure athletes don’t feel as though they will be punished if they come forward and we want people to listen,” he said.  In fact, the Janzens posted the video on YouTube to bring awareness and said people were extremely supportive and encouraged them for standing up for their daughter.  Not all the messages were positive though, so much so that they took the video down.  “We have also received a number of personal threats for taking a stance,” Craig said.  “Although detrimental to our well-being we will not let it get in the way of what we believe in and we will continue to fight for the well-being of athletes.”  An off-duty Durham Region police officer has been charged with harassment after an incident with a 10-year-old female Ayr hockey player on Nov. 30 at a tournament in Pittsburgh.  Times  Times  Times  "

On three central issues, however, Trump gave out misinformation that had to be corrected later, spreading panic everywhere from European airports to the financial markets. It was the latest in a series of confusing, misleading or inaccurate statements from administration officials on a matter of life and death to people in the U.S. and around the world.  Trump said the U.S. would “be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,” but within hours statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security clarified that it did not apply to legal permanent residents, or immediate family members of U.S. citizens. The fear of being stranded in Europe resulted in a  pre-dawn rush to airports  in tourist meccas such as Barcelona by American travelers trying to book flights home.  President Trump addressing the nation about the coronavirus on Wednesday. (Doug Mills/New York Times via AP, Pool)  Trump also said in his address that the restrictions would apply to “the tremendous amount of trade and cargo” across the Atlantic, but an hour later on Twitter he clarified that “the restriction stops people not goods.” The president also said that insurance companies were waiving copayments for testing and treatment related to coronavirus, but a hospital and insurance lobbying firm  It was not the first time inaccurate coronavirus information came from the White House. Last week  , Vice President Mike Pence had to correct Trump  about the rules on testing. In a White House briefing, Trump said “anybody that needs a test gets a test” for coronavirus, a misleading statement at the time and still not the case. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has badly lagged other countries in preparing a nationwide testing regime. Yet Trump repeated his claim on Thursday, stating, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth.”  Around the same time, across town on Capitol Hill, Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and serves on the White House coronavirus task force, was telling Congress that testing was going anything but smoothly.  “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” said Fauci. “This is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it. The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that.”  As of Thursday morning  , the CDC was testing only 100 people per day  , a small fraction of those seeking to be tested. Some additional tests were being administered by state public-health agencies and private laboratories, but still far below the rate of testing in other countries.   On Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”  On Feb. 26, Trump said at a coronavirus briefing, “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”  As of Thursday the United States recorded 1,300 cases, with 38 deaths.  "

The Peaky Blinders star died of cancer last week at the age of just 52.  Lewis revealed the conversation in an emotional tribute to his wife at the weekend, after her death was announced on Friday, April 16, BirminghamLive reports. The Homeland and Billions actor was writing in the Sunday Times. He said that few people were funnier and more positive than her - even during the darkest moments of her illness. McCrory, who famously played Polly in Peaky Blinders, leaves behind her two children with Lewis - Manon, 14, and Gulliver, 13.       Helen McCrory with husband Damian Lewis after she was awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II  (Image: Getty Images)   Lewis said his wife had “lived by the principle of kindness and generosity” and always took an interest in others and “made them feel special”. He said: “I’ve never known anyone so consciously spread happiness. Even when dying in her last few days, when talking to our wonderful carers, she repeatedly said, ‘thank you so much’ in her half-delirious state. “She always asked people how they were, always took an interest, made each person she met feel special, as though they were the only person in the room. Gave them her full attention. It made them laugh, always. There were few funnier people - she was funny as hell.” Lewis said his wife had addressed any future relationships in the weeks before her death.       Helen McCrory  (Image: BBC)   He wrote: “She said to us from her bed: ‘I want Daddy to have girlfriends, lots of them, you must all love again, love isn’t possessive, but you know, Damian, try at least to get through the funeral without snogging someone’.” In the piece, Lewis also recalled a hilarious encounter McCrory had with legendary movie star Lauren Bacall. Bacall had gone backstage to congratulate her after she starred in stage play Uncle Vanya in New York. She told McCrory her performance as Sonya was “magnificent” and “moved her to tears”, Lewis recounted.

However, she will be most remembered for her powerful TV characters. Harry Potter role  She played Narcissa Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, appeared in James Bond film Skyfall and portrayed Cherie Blair twice.   Mrs Blair, the wife of former PM Tony Blair, paid her own tribute saying: “ Rest in peace Helen McCrory. My heart goes out to her husband Damian Lewis and their children for their sad loss.  “I was lucky enough to meet her, and I was flattered and humbled that someone so beautiful and talented agreed to play me in the films The Queen and The Special Relationship. She was amazing in Peaky Blinders.” McCrory was born in Paddington, London, to a Welsh mother and Scottish father and was the eldest of three children.       Damian Lewis and Helen McCrory at the Keats-Shelley Romantic Poetry Prize  (Image: Getty Images)   She attended school in Hertfordshire, then spent a year living in Italy before returning to London to study acting at the Drama Centre. Lewis wrote that his wife was “fiercely proud” of her career and approached it with “a rigour, an honesty and an intelligence that made others rise to meet her”. He said she was seen as “royalty” within the industry and was nicknamed “Dame Helen” by many. “Although we’ll never know now whether that would have become a reality, I think secretly, we do know,” he wrote. Lewis also said he had never “known anyone able to enjoy life as much” as his wife.   He wrote: “Her ability to be in the present and enjoy the moment was inspirational. Nor was she interested in navel-gazing. No real interest in self-reflection; she believed in looking out, not in. “Which is why she was able to turn her light so brightly on others.” Lewis said his wife told her children repeatedly she had “lived the life I wanted to”. He went on: “She has exhorted us to be courageous and not afraid. She has been utterly heroic in her illness. Funny, of course - generous, brave, uncomplaining, constantly reminding us all of how lucky we’ve been, how blessed we are.” He added that McCrory’s “most exquisite act of bravery and generosity” had been to “normalise” her death. Lewis said: “She’s shown no fear, no bitterness, no self-pity, only armed us with the courage to go on and insisted that no one be sad because she is happy,” he said. “I’m staggered by her. She’s been a meteor in our life.”   Keep up with all of the latest local news with our daily newsletter  "

He died two years later.- 'On our terms'-Two decades ago, Mugabe seized more than 4,000 farms from the country's 4,500 white large-scale commercial farmers.He justified the land grabs as a way to correct historical wrongs by claiming back land that was forcibly taken from the blacks.Critics blame the land programme for wreaking havoc on the agriculture sector -- a mainstay of the economy.Economic output fell by half following the land seizures and the economy has been hobbled since -- shrinking 7.5 percent last year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in a letter to the IMF in April, projected the economy could contract by between 15 and 20 percent, partly due to the coronavirus pandemic.Food shortages experienced over most of the post-land reform years are widely blamed on the loss of white farmers.The coronavirus pandemic has only worsened the shortages.Two successive droughts have stunted agricultural harvests, leaving 7.7 million, half the population, food insecure.According to the World Food Programme, 56 of the country's 60 districts are experiencing ""crisis"" hunger and the virus pandemic risks driving people into ""deeper desperation"".President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised to import food to feed them ""so that no one will starve"".For Chinyemba, the government was right ""repossessing"" land from the whites, but they deserve compensation, if only for improvements.""I don't feel any remorse at all. The land belongs to the indigenous people. If the whites want to farm, they should do so on our terms.""He said while black ""people were killed,"" when their land was taken from them, but ""in all fairness, (whites) should get compensation"" for improvements.- 'Willing buyer' -For white Zimbabweans, the programme was an invasion of their property. To the blacks, it was the final battle in the country's liberation since they first rose against British colonialists in the 19th century.Story continuesThe land issue almost derailed the negotiations with Britain that led to the birth of Zimbabwe in 1980.Ultimately a deal was struck that the new government would not embark on any land reforms in the first decade in power.After that, a ""willing buyer, willing seller"" principle came into effect with Britain to fund the buying of white-owned farms.But in 1997, Clare Short, then British Secretary of State for International Development told Harare that London had ""no special responsibility to meet the cost of land purchases.""Sporadic invasions of white-owned farms ensued, but the government curbed them, with Mugabe assuring white farmers that ""squatting"" would not be tolerated.Simons said white farmers deluded themselves into thinking they were untouchable and indispensable ""royal game"" because agriculture was key to the economy.All that changed when in February 2000 after a constitutional referendum with a clause that would legalise expropriation of white farms without compensation, was rejected.Days later, veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war started running white farmers off their land.A year later, the government formalised the reform programme. Farms were either sub-divided into six-hectare plots or handed out whole to blacks.Thirty kilometres west of Harare, 60-year-old Israel Pasipanodya Mushore inherited Rasper farm. But it has not been easy work.In contrast to Chinyemba's, his farm is rundown. What used to be a swimming pool is now a fishpond.Weeds choked the maize crop. His showpiece is a herd of 70-plus cattle.In 2016 government introduced the ""command agriculture"" scheme to supply farmers with so-called inputs -- seeds, fertilisers and insecticides -- and they pay back on harvesting.The scheme brought hope, but not enough.""Equipment and inputs are our biggest challenge; we have no draught power,"" Mushore said.Inputs were not timely disbursed to farmers, or just didn't get to them.Funding remains one of the biggest challenges.Currently all land belongs to the state and farms operate on 99-year leases.Financial institutions refuse to lend in the absence of collateral.""The 99-year lease on its own, in its current form has not inspired confidence to the financiers,"" said Paul Zakariya, who heads the Zimbabwe Farmers Union, which represents over a million small-scale farmers.Ben Gilpin, who lost a farm, agrees.""If the farmers were on the land with title or some bankable entity that is truly tradable and can be honoured by the banks, government wouldn't have to fulfil the role,"" said Gilpin, who is the director of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents mostly white farmers.- Compensation -Zimbabwe's government insists it will only pay compensation for improvements on the farms that were taken and for not the land.John Laurie, 83, lost two farms in 2002, then valued at US$9-million.Now wheel-chair bound and a double amputee, Laurie is one of the farmers' representatives negotiating compensation with the government.""We hope to have an agreement on a global figure for the immovable assets shortly,"" he said.The government has made ""interim relief"" payments to especially old and destitute farmers.Some 800 farmers have so far been paid the equivalent of US$10,000 for each farm lost.But 20 years on, the land reforms remain a work in progress.After carrying out a land audit, government vowed to slash the size of under-utilised large farms and tackle multiple farm ownership.Opinions on the reforms remain split. But even those who lost farms agree the situation where white farmers occupied the best agricultural land while millions of black Zimbabweans were cramped on semi-arid land, was untenable.Economically though, the reforms are widely seen as a failure.Independent economist Tony Hawkins, said agriculture's share of GDP has fallen from about 15 percent to less than 10 per cent.Despite several attempts, AFP failed to obtain a government response.But for the Zimbabwean leadership, Mugabe's farming legacy continues to empower blacks.""Our land reform programme remains a fundamental cog to our independence and sovereignty,"" Mnangagwa said during independence celebrations in April.""To this, there is no wavering or going back."""

Staff who are not vaccinated for any type of medical reason must identify the reasons, he said, and do regular testing. “If we find any of our employees are simply unvaccinated due to personal choice – they will need to participate in a mandatory testing program. Right now we believe that will be a weekly program,” he said.

But these stellar beings don't just completely vanish, stars always leave something behind. Some stars explode in a supernova, turning into a black hole or a neutron star, while the majority of stars become white dwarfs, a core of the star it once used to be. However, a new study reveals that these white dwarfs contribute more to life in the cosmos than previously believed. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggests that white dwarf stars are the main source of carbon atoms in the Milky Way, a chemical element known to be crucial to all life.White dwarf stars are a primary source for one of the building blocks of life. NASA and H. Richer (University of British Columbia)When stars like our own Sun, a yellow dwarf star, run out of fuel, they turn into a white dwarf. In fact, 90 percent of all stars in the universe end up as white dwarf stars. White dwarfs are hot, dense stellar remains with temperatures that reach 100,000 Kelvin. Over time, billions of years, these stars cool and eventually dim as they shed their outer material. However, right before they collapse, their remains are transported through space by winds that originate from their bodies. These stellar ashes contain chemical elements such as carbon. Carbon is the fourth most abundant chemical in the universe and is a key element in the formation of life as it is the basic building block to most cells.All of the carbon in the universe originated from stars, therefore the phrase that we are made of stars is not only poetic but rather accurate. However, astronomers could not agree on which type of star is responsible for spreading the most amount of carbon across the cosmos.  The scientists behind the new study used observations of white dwarfs in open star clusters, groups of a few thousand stars formed around the same time, in the Milky Way by the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii in 2018.They measured the stars' initial-final mass relation, which is the relationship between the stars' masses when they first formed and their masses as white dwarfs. Usually, the larger the star was, the more massive a white dwarf will be. However, the study found that the stars' masses as white dwarfs were larger than the scientists had anticipated considering their initial mass when they first formed. “Our study interprets this kink in the initial-final mass relationship as the signature of the synthesis of carbon made by low-mass stars in the Milky Way,” Paola Marigo, a researcher at the University of Padua in Italy, and lead author of the study, said in a statement. The team of scientists concluded that stars bigger than 2 solar masses also contributed to the galactic enrichment of carbon, while stars of less than 1.5 solar masses did not.“Now we know that the carbon came from stars with a birth mass of not less than roughly 1.5 solar masses,” Marigo said.The new study suggests that carbon was essentially trapped in the raw material that formed the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago.Abstract: The initial–final mass relation (IFMR) links the birth mass of a star to the mass of the compact remnant left at its death. While the relevance of the IFMR across astrophysics is universally acknowledged, not all of its fine details have yet been resolved. A new analysis of a few carbon–oxygen white dwarfs in old open clusters of the Milky Way led us to identify a kink in the IFMR, located over a range of initial masses, 1.65 ≲Mi/M⊙≲ 2.10. The kink’s peak in white dwarf mass of about 0.70−0.75 M⊙ is produced by stars with Mi ≈ 1.8−1.9 M⊙, corresponding to ages of about 1.8−1.7 Gyr. Interestingly, this peak coincides with the initial mass limit between low-mass stars that develop a degenerate helium core after central hydrogen exhaustion, and intermediate-mass stars that avoid electron degeneracy. We interpret the IFMR kink as the signature of carbon star formation in the Milky Way. This finding is critical to constraining the evolution and chemical enrichment of low-mass stars, and their impact on the spectrophotometric properties of galaxies."

description,world.people.com.cn,                        人民网北京7月7日电 据外交部网站消息，外交部发言人汪文斌主持7日例行记者会。记者会实录如下：   《中国日报》记者：近日，中国常驻维也纳联合国代表团主办的2021年维也纳联合国中文日活动拉开帷幕。你能否介绍有关情况？   汪文斌：中国常驻维也纳联合国代表团举办了以“传承历史，续写华章”为主题的联合国中文日活动。70个国家和国际组织的大使、高级外交官以及维也纳各国际组织高官出席。此前，中国常驻联合国代表团、中国常驻日内瓦代表团、中国驻非盟使团等也分别通过博物馆导览、讲座授课、观看中国传统文化表演、海外征集外国人原创中文影像作品等丰富多彩的形式，举办联合国中文日庆祝活动。   2010年，联合国确立了联合国中文日，到今年已经有12个年头了。以汉字为书写载体的中文是中华文明的智慧结晶，也是全人类的共同财产。中文是联合国六种工作语言之一，也是世界上使用人数最多的语言。长期以来，中文的运用保障了联合国工作的有效开展，也促进了中外人文交流和民心互通。中文以其深厚的文化底蕴和丰富的文化意涵，正吸引越来越多的外国友人。截至2020年底，全球共有180多个国家和地区开展中文教育，70多个国家将中文纳入国民教育体系，外国正在学习中文的人数超过2000万，累计学习和使用中文的人数接近2亿。孔子学院、孔子课堂等中文教育机构也为帮助各国人民学习中文、了解中国发挥了重要桥梁作用。   文明因多样而精彩，因互鉴而发展。语言是文化交流、文明互鉴的重要载体。我们高兴地看到世界各地学习和使用中文的人越来越多，在我们外交部例行记者会上用中文提问的外国记者朋友也越来越多。我们将继续为各国朋友学习中文提供必要的便利和协助。   日本共同社记者：7月11日是《中朝友好合作互助条约》签订60周年。条约规定每20年自动延长。今年将继续自动延长吗？国际情况也有很大变化，有关条约不需要修改吗？朝鲜驻中国新一任大使2月份已到任，中国驻朝鲜大使什么时候轮换？   汪文斌：根据《中朝友好合作互助条约》规定，该条约在未经双方就修改或终止问题达成协议以前，将一直有效。   关于你提到的中朝关系问题，我想告诉大家，中朝双方签订友好合作互助条约是两国老一辈领导人高瞻远瞩作出的战略决策，是两国关系史上的一件大事。条约旨在加强中朝友好合作，维护地区和平稳定。60年来，在条约精神指引下，中朝双方相互支持，密切合作，不仅有力推动了各自社会主义建设事业，也为维护地区乃至世界和平稳定作出了重要贡献。   在新时期新形势下，中方愿同朝方一道，继承传统，面向未来，切实贯彻落实两党两国最高领导人达成的重要共识，按照时代发展要求和两国人民共同愿望，推动中朝传统友好合作关系不断向前发展，更好造福两国人民，并为促进国际地区和平稳定与发展繁荣作出新贡献。   在国与国关系当中，大使轮换是一项正常安排。你关心的中方驻朝大使何时轮换的问题，目前我没有具体消息向你提供。   彭博社记者：澳大利亚国库部长弗莱登伯格对《时代报》表示，一些他现在拒绝的中国投资协议，换在以前会同意，因为今天澳大利亚在跟一个不一样的中国打交道，中方展现出一种寸步不让的强硬作风。外交部对此有何评论？   汪文斌：中方从未做过有损澳大利亚主权和利益的事，我们奉劝澳大利亚有关人士摒弃冷战思维和意识形态偏见，尊重基本事实，客观理性看待中国和中国的发展，停止出于一己政治私利鼓噪中国威胁论，停止发表不负责任的言论。   总台央视记者：据报道，近期一些非洲国家政要和媒体纷纷发声驳斥“中国制造了非洲债务陷阱”的说法。中方对此有何评论？   汪文斌：我们已多次表明在相关问题上的立场。中方已全面落实二十国集团（G20）“暂缓最贫困国家债务偿付倡议”，积极支持G20就缓债倡议延期至今年年底达成重要共识，并稳妥参与以个案为基础的多边债务处理。中方有关非官方金融机构也参照缓债倡议采取了缓债行动。   长期以来，中国一直秉持正确义利观处理借贷、缓债等问题，将真实亲诚等原则切实落到实处。中方举措有力促进了债务国经济社会发展，有效缓解了其债务负担，受到非洲等国肯定和欢迎。卢旺达总统卡加梅近期表示，中国从未强迫任何国家借贷。纳米比亚、肯尼亚、塞内加尔、博茨瓦纳等国总统也都公开力挺中非之间的投融资合作。肯尼亚《人民报》强调中国贷款都落实到具体项目用于发展合作。卢旺达资深媒体人姆班达以事实和数据揭批美西方渲染“中国制造了非洲债务陷阱”的说法，表示这完全是出于政治目的，意在离间非中关系。   我注意到，日前在境外知名问答平台Quora上，针对“非洲国家如无法偿还对华债务该怎么办？”这一话题，非洲国家网民纷纷指出，西方国家以前从未关心过非洲，现在突然变成“非洲人的保护者”并向中国“甩锅”，完全是出于嫉妒。这一度成为热门话题。   习近平主席指出，在人类追求幸福的道路上，一个国家、一个民族都不能少。世界上所有国家、所有民族都应该享有平等的发展机会和权利。中方将继续秉持真实亲诚理念，同非洲国家和国际社会一道落实“支持非洲发展伙伴倡议”，为帮助非洲国家实现发展振兴作出不懈努力。   韩联社记者：昨天中国政府朝鲜事务特别代表刘晓明同美国国务院对朝政策特别代表通电话，双方就半岛问题进行了沟通，请问外交部对这次通话有何评论？此次通话有何意义？   汪文斌：昨天，中国政府朝鲜半岛事务特别代表刘晓明应约同美国务院对朝政策特别代表金圣通电话。中方阐述了对半岛问题的立场和对美国对朝政策审议结果的看法，强调应按照“双轨并进”思路和分阶段、同步走原则推进半岛问题政治解决进程。美方应重视解决朝方正当合理关切，支持朝韩和解合作。美方表示将致力于通过外交方式解决半岛问题，希望尽快与朝恢复对话接触，支持朝韩改善关系。   中方近期在不同层级同有关方就半岛问题保持沟通。刘晓明特别代表就任以来也在积极同各方交流。中方在半岛问题上的立场是一贯和明确的。半岛的事是中国家门口的事，中方将一如既往发挥建设性作用，直到半岛实现长治久安。   法新社记者：昨天美国国务卿布林肯会见了自称曾被关押在新疆拘留营的维族人，你对此有何评论？   汪文斌：中方多次强调，涉疆问题不是民族、宗教、人权问题，而是反暴恐、去极端化、反分裂问题。“虐待”“暴行”“种族灭绝”，这些罪行根本扣不到中方头上。美方的谎言谣言早已被新疆繁荣稳定、人民安居乐业的事实和真相所揭穿。美方妄图打着人权的幌子祸乱新疆、遏制中国发展的图谋绝不会得逞。   今日俄罗斯记者：据日本媒体报道，日本新的“网络安全战略”草案首次提出可能面对来自中国和俄罗斯的“威胁”的迹象。这份草案显示，有迹象表明，中国正在发起网络攻击，从军事相关和高科技企业窃取信息，而俄罗斯正在追求军事和政治目标。中方对此有何评论？   汪文斌：日方罔顾基本事实，恶意渲染“邻国威胁”，这是日本“谎言外交”的又一体现。我注意到日前有学者指出，同周边所有邻国关系都不好的国家就是日本。日方应当深刻反思自己所作所为，多做有利于增进与邻国政治互信、有利于地区和平稳定的事，而不是动辄拿邻国说事，服务自身不可告人的目的。   至于网络安全，世界上到底哪个国家最热衷于搞“网络窃密”以及各种窃听、窃密行径，这对全世界来说都不是什么秘密。日方在网络安全上无端抹黑中国、俄罗斯，这完全是搞错了对象。人们不禁要问，日方故意炮制这样的谎言，是不是得到了谁的授意、试图帮忙转移焦点呢？   澎湃新闻记者：据美国媒体报道，近期民调显示69%的美国人相信种族歧视仍然是美国一大社会问题，60%的人认为这一问题比一年前更为严重。美国加利福尼亚大学学者马伊斯认为，种族主义是美国社会生活的核心特征。中方对此有何评论？   汪文斌：我们注意到有关报道，可以说在美国，种族主义是全面性、系统性、持续性的存在，种族歧视是美国社会的顽疾，是严重的人权问题。   据报道，60%的美国非洲裔认为他们经常在求职和购物时被歧视，在住房申请、贷款办理、保险领取等问题上所受歧视也屡见不鲜。在美国所有完成2剂新冠疫苗接种的人群当中，白人占比达64.3%，非洲裔只占8.6%。更骇人听闻的是，非洲裔遭警察杀害的概率是白人的3倍。除非洲裔外，美国对待印第安原住民、亚裔、拉美裔和穆斯林等少数族裔的种族主义劣行也十分猖獗，国际社会对此的批评之声不绝于耳。   美国的种族歧视还体现在法律层面，种族歧视受害者难以通过法律维护自身权利。1882年的《排华法案》是美国第一部针对特定族裔的种族歧视移民法，影响延续至今。美国迄今没有全国性的仇恨犯罪标准，也没有立法遏制网络仇恨言论和暴力。美国在加入《消除一切形式种族歧视国际公约》时，以“言论自由”为幌子，对《公约》明确禁止煽动和传播种族歧视言论的规定作出保留。联合国多次敦促美国撤回保留意见，美方都置之不理。   在58年前的《我有一个梦想》的演讲中，针对“民权运动人士什么时候才能满足”这个问题，马丁・路德・金先生给出的第一个答案就是：“只要黑人仍然遭受警察难以形容的野蛮迫害，我们就绝不会满足”。弗洛伊德的呼喊言犹在耳，而今年截至5月21日，又有89名非洲裔美国人死于美国警察枪口之下。我们希望美国政府能够正视自身的人权问题，出台实际行动，完善法律机制，而不是对他国人权状况说三道四。只有这样，马丁・路德・金先生的愿望才能够真正实现。   印度广播公司记者：上周，一些在华留学生写了一封公开信，称考虑到学校即将于9月开学，中国什么时候允许外国留学生来华？   汪文斌：中国政府高度重视外国留学生来华问题，将在确保防疫安全的前提下，统筹考虑外国留学生返华复课事宜。   北京青年报记者：近日，斯威士兰爆发示威暴乱，事态仍在发展。中方对斯威士兰局势有何评论？   汪文斌：中方高度关注斯威士兰局势发展，我们希望斯威士兰实现经济发展、改善民生。当前，新冠肺炎疫情仍在非洲蔓延。斯威士兰还面临抗击疫情和恢复经济的艰巨任务。中方愿向斯方提供包括疫苗在内的人道主义援助，帮助斯威士兰人民渡过难关。   我们还注意到，针对斯威士兰局势，美国、英国、欧盟纠集台湾当局发表了共同声明。台湾地区是中国的一部分，一个中国原则是公认的国际关系准则。我们敦促有关国家和组织切实恪守有关承诺，停止在国际上制造“两个中国”和“一中一台”。   凤凰卫视记者：白宫印太事务协调官坎贝尔出席一个论坛时表示，美中两国可以和平共存，美方不支持“台独”。但他同时也说如果北京作出违背和平稳定的举动，美方将作出回应，还称北京方面越来越独断，请问中方有何回应？   汪文斌：你提到了两个问题，分别涉及中美关系和中国对外政策。   关于中美关系，我想说的是，中国的发展进步靠的不是谁的恩赐和施舍，而是中国人民艰苦奋斗的结果。希望美方采取理性务实的对华政策，聚焦合作，管控分歧，推动中美关系健康稳定发展。   中方在台湾问题上的立场是一贯的、明确的。世界上只有一个中国，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。一个中国原则是中美关系的政治基础。我们敦促美方切实恪守一个中国原则和中美三个联合公报规定，在涉台问题上谨言慎行，停止向“台独”分裂势力发出错误信号，以免严重损害中美关系和台海和平稳定。   关于中国对外政策，前不久，习近平总书记在庆祝中国共产党成立100周年大会上发表的重要讲话中作出了论述。希望美方有关人士能够认真研读。这里我想给大家强调几点。   第一，中国力量的增长是世界和平力量的增长。中华民族的血液中没有侵略他人、称王称霸的基因。中国坚守和平、和睦、和谐的理念，坚定奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持走和平发展道路，为政治解决热点问题、维护国际和地区和平稳定提出中国方案、作出中国贡献，始终是世界和平的建设者。   第二，中国的发展是世界发展的动力。中国的发展离不开世界，世界的繁荣也离不开中国。中国坚持改革开放的基本国策，坚持互利共赢的开放战略，坚持走生态优先、绿色低碳的发展道路，推动共建“一带一路”高质量发展，以中国的新发展为世界提供新机遇，始终是全球发展的贡献者。   第三，中国追求的是人类共同进步。中国坚持为人类进步事业而奋斗，愿同世界上一切进步力量携手前进，弘扬和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由的全人类共同价值，坚持合作、不搞对抗，坚持开放、不搞封闭，坚持互利共赢、不搞零和博弈，反对霸权主义和强权政治，始终是国际秩序的维护者。   第四，中国捍卫的是国际公平正义。中国人民是崇尚正义、不畏强权的人民。中国欢迎一切有益的建议和善意的批评，但绝不接受“教师爷”般颐指气使的说教，将坚定不移走自己的路。中国不会去侵犯别国主权、干涉别国内政，也绝不允许别国侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政。这不仅是维护中国的正当权益，更是维护广大发展中国家的正当权益，维护国际关系的基本准则。   《人民日报》记者：据报道，5日，24名国际知名医学专家在权威医学杂志《柳叶刀》上发表联合声明，驳斥美国一些政客推动所谓新冠病毒“实验室泄漏论”。专家们表示，目前没有科学证据支持“实验室泄漏论”，最近的同行评审结果强烈表明该病毒是在自然界进化的。中方对此有何评论？   汪文斌：我注意到有关报道。世卫组织联合专家组报告也明确指出，病毒从实验室泄漏极不可能。但令人遗憾的是，一个时期以来我们看到，美方一些人士在溯源问题上搞政治操弄越来越露骨。从抹黑中国抗疫成就到鼓吹中国“实验室泄漏论”，从诋毁世卫组织联合专家组权威报告到打压秉持客观立场的科学工作者和专家，从动用情报部门介入溯源到推动开展把中国排除在外的所谓“独立调查”。这些人的目的只有一个，就是借此把自身抗疫失败的责任转嫁到中国身上。   无论这些人怎样变换政治操弄的手法，事实都不会改变：导致60多万美国民众失去生命的，正是那些无视科学、把抗疫政治化的美国政客。   世卫组织联合专家组作出的权威结论也不会改变：溯源工作应基于全球视野，未来溯源工作不会局限于某一区域，需要多国多地开展。   国际社会尊重科学、坚持正义的大势更不会改变。把病毒溯源政治化、向别国甩锅推责的企图只会以失败告终。   法新社记者：英国主要反对党工党呼吁部长及王室抵制北京冬奥会，除非中国允许联合国调查新疆侵犯人权的指控，你对此有何评论？   汪文斌：我们多次强调，所谓新疆“强迫劳动”“侵犯人权”完全是极少数反华分子炮制的世纪谎言。   中方坚决反对将体育运动政治化，反对借“所谓”人权问题干涉别国内政。出于政治动机，试图干扰、阻碍、破坏北京冬奥会的筹办和举行是非常不负责任的，损害的是各国运动员的利益和国际奥林匹克事业。包括许多国家政府、奥委会以及国际奥委会在内的国际社会各界都明确反对这种错误做法。                                   (责编：徐祥丽、刘慧)     分享让更多人看到

The cable is back to where it was early in February and could see further falls if the break below 1.3775 is confirmed, according to FXStreet’s Analyst Yohay Elam.  See: GBP/USD to plummet towards the 1.3610/00 zone on a break below 1.3800 – OCBC  Key quotes  “President Joe Biden's advisors have been putting the final touches on an ambitious $3 trillion infrastructure program which means a hotter US economy. That is boosting the dollar.”  “Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will appear before Congress and they are set to shed light on current conditions and expectations for the future. Republicans will likely quiz them on inflation prospects, especially with grand expenditure.”  “After the EU threatened to block exports of AstraZeneca doses made in the continent to Britain, London and Brussels are trying to find solutions that may assure the ongoing flow of jabs on both sides of the Channel. Any compromise from Johnson could slow the UK's vaccination campaign, but after reaching 50% of the population, the risk seems low.”   “The labor market is sending mixed signals. While the UK's Unemployment Rate surprisingly dropped to 5% in January, jobless claims shot up by 86,500 in February. The more recent figures seem to have the upper hand – adding to sterling's misery.”   “Pound/dollar has slipped below 1.3775, which was the previous March low, and also provided support in mid-February. If the break below 1.3775 is confirmed, the next cushion is at 1.3745, which capped GBP/USD in early February. It is followed by 1.3580, a support line from the same period.”   “Some resistance is at 1.3810, a support line from last week, followed by 1.3860.”                                   "

Photograph: Paul Ellis/PA  The television licence could be abolished from 2027, with ministers saying they are “open minded” about how to fund the  BBC  from that point onwards, suggesting further cuts could be on the cards for the national broadcaster.  The culture secretary,  Nicky Morgan  , suggested the television licence was an increasingly outdated way of funding the BBC, saying that while she would guarantee its existence in the short term, it was time to look at new ways of subsidising public service broadcasting.  Launching a consultation on whether to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, Morgan compared the corporation to the defunct video rental chain  Blockbuster  , warning that once-mighty media institutions could collapse quickly if they failed to adapt to new formats.  “If you have to criminalise non-payment of the licence fee in order for the BBC to remain relevant then that suggests something is wrong with the model,” she told an audience in central London. “Criminal sanctions are for issues that are damaging to society.”  Morgan said she would guarantee the current model until the end of 2027 but “we must all be open-minded about the future of the licence fee beyond this point”, with alternative suggestions including a system in which different broadcasters would bid for a central pot of funding to produce public service output.  decriminalise the licence fee  and turn non-payment into a civil offence, a move which the BBC estimates will cost it at least £200m in funding and force it to make even more cuts to its output, are a long-term aim of many on the free-market wing of the Conservative party.  But the proposal has also been backed by women’s charities and prison reform campaigners, who say it is unfair that the vast majority of prosecutions are against women.  Naima Sakande, a women’s justice advocate at the law charity Appeal, said: “While the fee funds an important part of our media landscape, it cannot be right that non-payment of this household bill is treated differently from all other expenses.  “Criminal sanctions for this are sexist, outdated and unhelpful. These measures have no place in a modern system of justice.”  More than 120,000 people a year are prosecuted for non-payment of the licence fee, with five people sent to prison in 2018 for failing to pay fines relating to their cases.  The BBC’s director general, Tony Hall, announced last month that  he would stand down  to allow his successor to conduct negotiations with the government over the amount it can charge for the licence fee – currently set at £154.50 a year – between 2022 and 2027.  This could potentially be the last ever licence fee settlement, with many other European countries already moving away from the licence fee model. In Sweden, almost all adults pay a supplementary tax to fund public service broadcasting, regardless of whether they own a television set, with similar measures taking place in other Nordic countries. Other nations have chosen to fund their national broadcasters directly, using government funding.  A Netflix-style subscription model has also been proposed, although critics have pointed out it would be near-impossible to password-protect existing television channels, and that Netflix, which is loss-making, does not attempt to provide the universal news service offered by the BBC.  Morgan said she was committed to the universal approach of the BBC and its ability to bring together large audiences in one place, suggesting a password-protected subscription was not currently on the cards.  “I truly believe that, no matter how well-funded the international streaming giants are, British broadcasters remain essential. Universal availability means the BBC and other public service broadcasters can still create shared moments that bring the country together, be that through sports coverage, major events, great dramas or documentaries,” she said.  In response to claims the BBC could go the way of Blockbuster, a spokesperson for the broadcaster said: “The BBC tried to set up a Netflix service a decade ago while they were still sending DVDs in the post, but was prevented from doing so by regulators.  “There is a danger that politicians catastrophise the situation. The BBC is the most-used media organisation in the UK. It reaches the most people. It’s used for the most time. You wouldn’t think that from some of the things being said today.”  BBC licence fee  BBC  Nicky Morgan  "

The finance ministry disagrees and President Vladimir Putin has called on authorities to find a consensus.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 on Friday that he hoped disagreements could be ironed out and a bill regulating cryptocurrencies passed by the end of the year. He said the government would take the final decision.""I hope that, in the best-case scenario, it could be passed in the spring session,"" Siluanov said, though he acknowledged that broader debates may prolong its passage.Siluanov said his ministry proposed identifying crypto traders, which he said would separate the ""white"" market from the ""grey"" market.Giving law enforcement the power to trace money flows and transactions may diminish one of cryptocurrencies' major selling points - their anonymity.""The Russian government...appears to have taken the position that crypto assets are here to stay and is contemplating legislation with the aim of bringing the industry 'out of the shadows' and creating an opportunity for legal business,"" said David Henderson, senior associate at Browne Jacobson.A document seen by Reuters, however, shows the central bank does not support the ministry's proposals and wants an outright ban on the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrencies.The finance ministry and central bank did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.Andrey Kladov, former cryptocurrency expert at Russia's Internet Initiatives Development Fund and now engaged in digital banking in South Africa, said their diametrically opposed views could significantly hinder market development, giving time for the grey market to become even greyer.""A prohibitionist stance on it is absolutely useless, like banning umbrellas because 50 years ago someone killed a man with an umbrella,"" Kladov said. ""Everyone has umbrellas and every fifth or 10th person has cryptocurrency.""The central bank estimates the annual volume of cryptocurrency transactions in Russia at about $5 billion.In spite of the dispute, Siluanov said his ministry was working with the central bank to ensure that crypto assets did not appear on banks' balance sheets.(Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Christina Fincher)Vladimir PutinPresident of RussiaAnton SiluanovRussian Minister of Finance and First Deputy Prime Minister"

The Saudi leg is one of the most delicate trips he has faced on the world stage.,euronews.com,"A crucial meeting to repair one of the world's most important diplomatic relationships began with a fist bump Friday as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden at a royal palace.The first encounter, captured by Saudi television, occurred as Biden stepped out of his presidential limousine in Jeddah for a visit that is intended to reset their countries' longstanding partnership.There was little evidence of any warmth between the leaders, and none of the backslapping or smiles that Biden or the crown prince usually display when greeting other leaders.Biden had long refused to speak to Prince Mohammed, the presumed heir to the throne currently held by his father, King Salman. And he harshly criticized the oil-rich kingdom for its human rights abuses, particularly the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist.But those concerns have since been eclipsed by other challenges, including rising gas prices and Iranian aggression in the Middle East. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is looking to bolster its security relationship with the United States and seeking investments to transform its economy into one that’s less reliant on pumping oil.The Saudis held a subdued welcome for Biden at the airport in Jeddah, with none of the ceremony that accompanied his stop this week in Israel.The president sat down with King Salman, the 86-year-old monarch who has suffered from poor health, including two hospitalizations this year. Afterward, Biden and Prince Mohammed held a broader meeting with several advisers. There had been considerable speculation about both the choreography and the substance of how Biden, who had vowed as a presidential candidate to treat the Saudis as a “pariah” for their human rights record, would go about interacting with Prince Mohammed.Access for journalists was limited. The White House traveling press corps was not present when Biden fist bumped the crown prince, and reporters were only briefly allowed into their meeting. Almost none of their remarks could be heard. Biden did not answer when reporters asked if he still considered Saudi Arabia a “pariah,” nor did Prince Mohammed respond to a shouted question whether he would apologize to Khashoggi's family.Last year Biden's administration approved the release of a U.S. intelligence finding that determined the crown prince likely approved Khashoggi's killing. The release of the report caused a rupture in U.S.-Saudi relations.Before arriving in Saudi Arabia, Biden would not say if he would raise the issue directly with Prince Mohammed, and he did not do so within earshot of reporters on Friday.“My views on Khashoggi have been absolutely, positively clear. And I have never been quiet about talking about human rights,” Biden said earlier this week. “The reason I’m going to Saudi Arabia, though, is much broader. It’s to promote U.S. interests — promote U.S. interests in a way that I think we have an opportunity to reassert what I think we made a mistake of walking away from: our influence in the Middle East.”Biden arrived in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah on the third day of a four-day swing through the Middle East. He spent the first two days meeting with Israeli officials and traveled to the West Bank on Friday to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and others before flying to Saudi Arabia.The Saudi visit is one of the most delicate that Biden has faced on the international stage. Any kind of respectful greeting that Biden can manage, and the Saudi crown prince can reflect back, might help both sides soothe relations.But it could also open Biden, already floundering in the polls at home, to deeper criticism that he is backtracking on his pledges to put human rights at the center of foreign policy.Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, said that, with the visit to Saudi Arabia, Biden was backing down on human rights.""It’s a very huge backing down actually,” Cengiz told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. “It’s heartbreaking and disappointing. And Biden will lose his moral authority by putting oil and expediency over principles and values.”Biden’s criticism of the Saudis as a candidate became more tempered in recent months as Russia’s war on Ukraine aggravated what was already a global supply crunch for oil and gas. Elevated gasoline prices have driven inflation in the United States to its highest levels in four decades."

यूएपीए: ‘खौफनाक कानून' के इस्तेमाल में टॉप पर है प्रदेश, योगी और भाजपा को लग सकता है तगड़ा झटका ",No description,amarujala.com," देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।   जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।  मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।  वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है। उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।  यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई बेहद सख्त प्रावधान किए गए हैं। इस कानून के तहत केस में अग्रिम जमानत नहीं मिल सकती। किसी भी भारतीय या विदेशी के खिलाफ इस कानून के तहत केस चल सकता है। अपराध कहां पर हुआ है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। विदेशी धरती पर अपराध किए जाने के मामले में भी इसके तहत मुकदमा दर्ज हो सकता है। यह कानून एनआईए को अधिकार देता है कि वह किसी तरह की आतंकी गतिविधि में शामिल संदिग्ध को आतंकी घोषित कर सकती है। पहले यह व्यवस्था थी कि आतंकवाद के किसी भी मामले में संपत्ति अटैच करने की कार्यवाही जांच अधिकारी बिना डीजीपी की अनुमति लिए नहीं कर सकता था। अब एनआईए का जांच अफसर सिर्फ एनआईए के डीजी की इजाजत लेकर कार्रवाई कर सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।    विस्तार   देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।      जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।           मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।      5922 में से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हुआ    वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है।    कई हस्तियों को यूएपीए के तहत जेल में डाला गया है    उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।     2019 में हुए संशोधन से यूएपीए कानून 'कठोर' बन गया है    यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई बेहद सख्त प्रावधान किए गए हैं। इस कानून के तहत केस में अग्रिम जमानत नहीं मिल सकती। किसी भी भारतीय या विदेशी के खिलाफ इस कानून के तहत केस चल सकता है। अपराध कहां पर हुआ है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। विदेशी धरती पर अपराध किए जाने के मामले में भी इसके तहत मुकदमा दर्ज हो सकता है। यह कानून एनआईए को अधिकार देता है कि वह किसी तरह की आतंकी गतिविधि में शामिल संदिग्ध को आतंकी घोषित कर सकती है। पहले यह व्यवस्था थी कि आतंकवाद के किसी भी मामले में संपत्ति अटैच करने की कार्यवाही जांच अधिकारी बिना डीजीपी की अनुमति लिए नहीं कर सकता था। अब एनआईए का जांच अफसर सिर्फ एनआईए के डीजी की इजाजत लेकर कार्रवाई कर सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।              "

And by “comforting,” we mean ready to test our eardrums and live-music endurance in the most excellent of ways. Back with three full days of live performances from more than 150 local and national acts, the event takes over three outdoor stages and even more indoor venues in the Baker neighborhood from Friday, July 29, through Sunday, July 31. The lineup is also more diverse than ever, with rising and established indie rock, folk, hip hop, pop, EDM and other acts from across the globe. Highlights include Audrey Nuna, The Knocks, Faye Webster, The Beths, Seratones, Sudan Archives, Jawny, Bully, The Beths, Companion, Brasstracks and so many more. There are too many local acts to count, and we recommend popping in and out of whatever sounds good to you, as your wristband grants access to all venues, South by Southwest-style. The first day alone offers highlights (in no particular order) such as Los Mocochetes, N3PTUNE, Izcalli, Pink Hawks, Schama Noel, Jen Korte & the Loss, Kid Astronaut, Nina de Freitas, Big Dopes, Kayla Marque, Destino, Lady Denim, Ray Reed, Wes Watkins, Don Chicharron, Fast Eddy, Tres Leches, Flaural, and Hex Kitten.       Visit denverpostmusic.com for archived profiles of many of this year’s artists, and Colorado Public Radio’s Indie 102.3 for expert picks. See the full, interactive list and schedule at undergroundmusicshowcase.com/lineup. As a rule of thumb, remember to bring sunscreen and stay hydrated, and be patient with venue and festival staff, as the whole thing’s more of a jog than a sprint, with an estimated 10,00 attendees over the three days. Whether you’re new to the sprawling, walkable event or a festival veteran, here’s how this year’s refreshed UMS works:  Tickets can be purchased for the entire festival or individual days. A full-weekend pass costs $100 (a bargain, if you ask us), while single-day tickets are $50 for Friday and Sunday, and $65 for Saturday. Kids under 10 are free. Kids 10 and up are full price. Anyone under 16 must be accompanied by an adult at all times, “no exceptions,” organizers wrote. Many stages and venues are 21 and up, so call or Google ahead. Visit bit.ly/3z52yDq for tickets and more details. Venues are spread out along the South Broadway corridor between Sixth and Alameda avenues, just south of downtown Denver, where scooters and bike rentals are available. See the top-rated shops for bike rentals at bit.ly/3OyLz2l. RTD’s Route 0 runs the entire length; see the schedule at rtd-denver.com/app/route/0/schedule. There’s no on-site parking. The festival’s largest areas are between East First Avenue and West Third Avenue, where the outdoor UMS Stage and Oasis Stage are located, and the outdoor Showcase Stage, between Ellsworth and Bayaud avenues. Outdoor stages close at 10 p.m. This year’s event has a new nonprofit component and sober bars at every outdoor stage. Denver music-education organization Youth on Record is now co-owner of the festival, along with existing owner and producer Two Parts. It has instituted higher pay rates for artists, and has coordinated a number of booths offering mental health resources. Its impact show, at 6:35 p.m. on Saturday, July 30, takes place at the Showcase Stage. For more, visit bit.ly/3S6vVhn.

Under the order's conditions, renters must sign a declaration that they make less than $99,000 a year, or twice that amount if filing a joint tax return.The order ""does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract,"" according to the CDC's order.Landlords can continue to collect ""fees, penalties or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract,"" according to the order.The order expires on 31 December.As many as 40m people in the US could be at risk of eviction, according to the Aspen Institute, while nearly half of all renters in the US are cost-burdened, or paying more than 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.Protests across the US led by renters, tenant organisations and housing groups have demanded local and federal governments ""cancel rent"" and extend eviction moratoriums.""A uniform, national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent is long overdue and badly needed,"" the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement. ""The very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won't lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration's action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.""The organisation said that while the""eviction moratorium is an essential step,"" it is merely a ""half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,"" according to the organisation.""This action delays but does not prevent evictions,"" the statement said.The order follows a series of executive orders from Donald Trump, sidestepping Congress after it failed to extend federal unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, as locally issued moratoriums on eviction proceedings were lifted and courts reopened their dockets.But the president's order did not immediately halt evictions, despite his emphatic claims last month that renters are ""not going to be evicted"" because of his order.""We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen,"" he said last month. ""We're not going to evict people ... We are not letting people be evicted.""His order, signed on 8 August, directed federal agencies to ""consider"" whether halting evictions are necessary as a health precaution during the pandemic.House Democrats passed two measures with up to $100 billion for rental assistance, but the Republican-dominated Senate has not agreed to take up the legislation.The National Low Income Housing Coalition has urged the president to work with Congress to put in place a national moratorium on all evictions with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and housing vouchers, and another $11.5 billion for emergency resources for people experiencing homelessness.""Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression,"" the organisation's president Diane Yentel said. ""Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless."""

Liverpool released a “COVID-19 update” on Saturday afternoon, announcing that some of the club’s non-playing staff will be placed on furlough.  The move will apply to around 200 workers who have been affected by the lack of football being played as well as the closing down of club shops and other operations while the Premier League is on hold. The announcement stated that the club will continue to make sure these staff members receive 100 percent of their wages. What wasn’t clear was the fact that 80 percent of these wages, up to a monthly cap of £2,500, will be paid for by the government and, ultimately, the taxpayer, with Liverpool topping up the other 20 percent—or more in the event any of these workers are on more than £2,500 per month. “Liverpool FC has placed some staff who are impacted by the Premier League suspension on furlough,” read the statement. “The club has confirmed those staff will be paid 100 percent of their salaries to ensure no member of staff is financially disadvantaged.  “Last month the club also confirmed that it would pay its matchday and non-matchday staff while the Premier League is suspended.”  Though the 80-20 split wasn’t indicated in this statement, perhaps intentionally, the use of the word “furlough” reveals that they will be using the government scheme. For a club owned by a billionaire to be using government money, state money, ultimately taxpayer money, in order to make up for some of their losses during this time is, to put it mildly, irresponsible.  It is especially so when as much money and resources as possible are desperately needed in those areas of society tackling the coronavirus head on, and dealing with the numerous issues it raises for the most vulnerable within communities.    The club does a lot of good work in the community through Red Neighbours and supports numerous local charities and organisations, but a cold-hearted business manoeuvre such as this must be disheartening for those involved in these areas, as well as for many supporters. Given the awareness shown by several players, as well as manager Jurgen Klopp, around such issues, there might be a number of people throughout the club who won’t be too pleased with this decision.      Players have led the way  A large, anonymous contribution recently made to a Glasgow foodbank was believed to be from Andy Robertson.  No PR spin, no publicity, just a contribution to where it was needed from someone with money to spare and remembers their roots.  Robertson probably hated the fact that the Times found out he was the source of the donation.    The Liverpool squad, along with Red Neighbours and the LFC Foundation, contributed £40,000 to Fans Supporting Foodbanks—an increasingly vital resource as shopping for supplies has been difficult even for those who can afford them, let alone those who need to use foodbanks. Then, Jordan Henderson led the call for Premier League players to give up some of their salaries to help the NHS and various causes during this time, which would mean they still receive their wage as normal, so their tax would still be paid as normal, but they would be giving money to where it is most needed. The club’s move to take taxpayer money to pay wages which are a drop in the ocean to them is undoing these positive contributions from the players, both financially and ethically.    This is part of the reason the players, via the PFA, have not bowed to the pressure being put on them to take a wage cut. It’s a heated topic in the football bubble at the moment. Why don’t the players take a pay cut? The better question would be, why did the Tories target Premier League footballers for criticism, and not the even richer club owners? (Or other larger businesses…) Looking beyond the huge sums Premier League players earn, it’s really no surprise that the Tories’ target was not the clubs and their owners, many of them billionaires, but the players.  Many footballers are from working-class backgrounds. They also happen to be, and/or have worked hard at being, really good at a sport which can earn them a lot of money regardless of their class, background or upbringing.  This doesn’t sit well with right-wing governments who like the money to remain in the hands of the ruling elite, whether they be monarchy, high-ranking politicians, bankers or any of the big businesses and corporations who help them ensure this money remains their hands and doesn’t filter down. Should players be forced to take pay cuts? No. The amount of tax they pay (if they pay it as they should) is useful in itself, and a pay cut would just be saving the owners money rather than it going to where it is needed.  Should those with surplus money (which is most Premier League footballers) be choosing to give their money to where it is needed in order to help during this crisis? Yes, and the PFA have indicated that this is what the players want to do, but they are also aware that a salary reduction would only benefit the club owners, and not necessarily the areas of society most in need of funds. “Taking a 30 percent salary deduction will cost the Exchequer substantial sums,” read a PFA statement on behalf of the players. “This would be detrimental to our NHS and other government-funded services. The proposed 30 percent salary deduction over a 12-month period equates to over £500 million in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over £200 million to the government.  “What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS? Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?” The NHS should not be seen as a charity, but the fact it has been underfunded for so long comes on the back of 10 years of a Conservative government. Putting the onus on the players is a handy get-out for the Tories and the billionaires they support across all industries.   Socialism for the rich…  Liverpool supporters might have expected their club to be different to the likes of Spurs and Newcastle, and they had committed to paying staff in full for the rest of the season. But even though they are still being paid in full, the club are no longer footing the full amount. Next time someone at ownership level trots out ‘This Means More’, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ or some mention of Shankly’s values, these will now feel like little more than PR platitudes. Hollow marketing slogans. CEO Peter Moore almost admitted as much when, in an interview with Spanish media outlet El Pais, he alluded to using Shankly’s beliefs in their marketing.  “Even today, when we talk about business, we ask ourselves: ‘What would Shankly do?’. What would Bill say in this situation?” said Moore. “He was a true socialist who believed that football consisted of working together. In the marketing department, we met and said: ‘Let’s put this into words’.” What would Shankly do in this situation?  As Mirror columnist Brian Reade pointed out: “Doubt he’d have said let the taxpayer pay some wages when you’ve just made £42m profit.”    The list of companies who shouldn’t be taking this handout which was, according to the BBC, “designed to support firms that have been badly hit,” is long but depressingly unsurprising. And many aren’t even topping up wages to 100 percent as Liverpool are doing.  The likes of Virgin Atlantic owned by billionaire Sir Richard Branson and Topshop owned by billionaire Sir Richard Green (there is a knighthood theme here too), Wetherspoons and McDonalds, are all rich enough to pay workers through this period, but are all turning to state funding because it saves them a few pennies. The rich are big fans of state benefits and socialism at times like this, just as the banks quite liked it when the taxpayer bailed them out in 2008, but they return to their quest of making sure these benefits don’t apply for the poor, or make sure they are vilified for claiming them, as soon as they are out of the mire.    When front-line NHS workers are still without the required personal protective equipment, putting their lives in danger every minute of every day in order to help others, and when the social care sector is more strained than ever, as much state money as possible is needed at the face of the crisis and the support structure behind it.  It is needed in communities like those around Anfield, St James’ Park and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It might ultimately be given by the players, while the clubs take away, yet the players are still the target. It definitely isn’t needed by football clubs and other big businesses run by billionaires who want to save an amount of money which barely registers in their accounts. Even if Liverpool go back on this decision, which may be the right thing to do and be another example of Fenway Sports Group listening to the supporters, this initial decision will still leave a sour taste and alienate even more fans who are getting increasingly sceptical of the way many football clubs are run.

الأسعار"".. تأمين بطولة الأمم الأفريقية.. توفر السلع بأسعار مخفضة في منافذ أمان.. رقابة تموينية على الأسواق ومواقف سيارات الأجرة.. افتتاح مقر متطور للجوازات والهجرة  لعبت وزارة الداخلية، خلال الفترة الماضية، دورا اجتماعيا وإنسانيا بارزا، مشاركة منها لرفع المعاناة عن كاهل المواطنين ورغم الأعباء والتحديات الكبرى لرجال الأمن لم تنس وزارة الداخلية دورها الخدمي والاجتماعي والإنساني لمساعدة المصريين في أزمات الغلاء ومواجهة جشع التجار من خلال طرح مبادرات خدمية ومساعدات مالية للفقراء، فضلا عن شن حملات واسعة على الأسواق لضبط المخالفين ومنع عمليات السرقة والغش والجشع  وفي هذا السياق، قامت وزارة الداخلية بإنشاء (منظومة أمان)، للمساهمة في تلبية احتياجات المواطنين من السلع الغذائية الأساسية بأسعار تنافسية؛ حيث تم افتتاح (1100) منفذ بمحافظات الجمهورية كافة، خاصةً بالمناطق الشعبية والأكثر احتياجًا منها (750) منفذا ثابتا ومحلا تجاريا، و(400) منفذ متحرك، وجار التوسع في فروع تلك المنظومة  كما أطلقت وزارة الداخلية هذا الأسبوع المرحلة الثامنة لمبادرة «كلنا واحد» لمساعدة الفقراء والمحتاجين وطرح مقررات السلع الغذائية بأسعار زهيدة لمواجهة التحديات وفتح منافذ لها في مختلف أنحاء الجمهورية  وفي هذا السياق، واصلت جميع مديريات الأمن على مستوى الجمهورية مشاركتها في فعاليات المرحلة الثامنة من مبادرة «كلنا واحد»، لتوفير السلع الأساسية وطرحها في (690) فرعا لكبرى السلاسل التجارية على مستوى الجمهورية لتوفير السلع الأساسية بأسعار مخفضة بنسب تصل إلى 30% لتخفيف العبء عن كاهل المواطنين  وتشهد المبادرة، إقبالًا جماهيريًا مكثفًا وسط إشادة من المواطنين، بتوجيهات رئيس الجمهورية، وحرصه على مساندة المواطنين من محدودى الدخل، وبالجهود المتواصلة لوزارة الداخلية للمساهمة في خفض أسعار السلع الأساسية والرقابة على الأسواق، كما أشاد المواطنون بالتفاعل الإيجابي للسلاسل التجارية مع تلك المبادرات لتوفير السلع الغذائية بالأسواق  ولم يتوقف دور وزارة الداخلية، في توفير السلع الغذائية للمواطنين بأسعار مخفضة، وإنما حرصت على شنّ حملات تموينية مكبرة لضبط الأسواق، وتحرير مخالفات للخارجين عن القانون  فيما تابعت القيادات الأمنية، بالإدارة العامة للمرور وفروعها الجغرافية على مستوى الجمهورية بجولات ميدانية تفقدوا خلالها الحالة الأمنية بالشوارع والميادين بنطاق المديريات، وكذا المرور على مواقف سيارات الأجرة والسرفيس؛ للتأكد من انتظام حركة نقل الركاب والتزام قائدى السيارات بتعريفة الأجرة المقررة، والتصدي لمخالفات زيادة تعريفة الركوب، تواكبًا مع الزيادة الجديدة المقررة على أسعار الوقود  وفي سياق متصل، شنّت الأجهزة الأمنية حملات رقابية لضبط حركة الأسواق، وتشديد الرقابة الأمنية لضبط المخالفات التموينية، والمتمثلة في قيام بعض أصحاب محطات الوقود بحجب كميات كبيرة منها لتحقيق أرباح غير مشروعة من جراء الاحتكار  وفى مجال تقديم الخدمات الجماهيرية، يظل المواطن المصري هو الهدف الأسمى للرسالة الأمنية لهيئة الشرطة، حيث حرصت الوزارة على تيسير إجراءات حصوله على كافة الخدمات الأمنية المقدمة له من خلال تحديث وميكنة وتطوير أقسام الأحوال المدنية والجوازات وصحف الحالة الجنائية على مستوى الجمهورية  وفي هذا السياق، بدأ المقر

المقام الأول إلى تقديم خدمات تليق بالمصريين والأجانب القادمين للبلاد  وتم استحداث منظومة الترقيم الآلي، والاستدعاء الرقمي لكافة الخدمات المقدمة، مع إستراتيجية متكاملة للتيسير على الجمهور وضعتها وزارة الداخلية، حيث تم تزويد المقر الجديد بأماكن لإنهاء إجراءات ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة وكبار السن  كما تم استخدام أحدث الوسائل التكنولوجية، في استخراج جوازات السفر المصرية وتجديدها، وإنشاء مركز نظم المعلومات والذي يعد من أكبر المراكز المتخصصة في هذا المجال بالشرق الأوسط  ويستوعب المقر الجديد كافة أشكال وأنواع البيانات وإمكانية التعامل معها، فضلًا عن استكمال منظومة التأشيرة الإلكترونية والتي بدأ تنفيذها للأجانب القادمين للبلاد من 46 دولة، إضافة إلى خدمات عديدة تقدمها الإدارة العامة للجوازات من بينها منح الجنسية المصرية وإثباتها وكل ما يتعلق بها  وسعيًا لتطوير وتحديث كافة الخدمات والارتقاء بمنظومة أداء الخدمة تم استحداث كارت إقامة ذكي، وفقًا لأحدث النظم التكنولوجية للترخيص للأجانب في الإقامة بالبلاد، يُمكنهم من التعامل مع المصالح الحكومية وغير الحكومية بسهولة ويسر  فيما واصلت أجهزة وزارة

Angus Campbell said Thursday the shameful record included alleged instances in which new patrol members would shoot a prisoner in order to achieve their first kill in a practice known as “blooding.” He said the soldiers would then plant weapons and radios to support false claims the prisoners were enemies killed in action.Campbell told reporters in Canberra the illegal killings began in 2009, with the majority occurring in 2012 and 2013. He said some members of the elite Special Air Service encouraged “a self-centered, warrior culture.”An Australian soldier takes position during a NATO/ISAF joint task force patrol in Afghanistan's Uruzgan province.Deshakalyan Chowdhury / AFP - Getty Images, fileThe chief was announcing the findings of a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and Army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. Brereton recommended 19 soldiers be investigated by police for possible charges, including murder.“To the people of Afghanistan, on behalf of the Australian Defence Force, I sincerely and unreservedly apologize for any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers,” Campbell said.He said he’d spoken directly to his Afghan military counterpart to express his remorse.“Such alleged behavior profoundly disrespected the trust placed in us by the Afghan people who had asked us to their country to help them,” Campbell said. “It would have devastated the lives of Afghan families and communities, causing immeasurable pain and suffering. And it would have put in jeopardy our mission and the safety of our Afghan and coalition partners.”Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics As well as the 39 killings, the report outlines two allegations of cruel treatment. It says that none of the alleged crimes were committed during the heat of battle.The report said a total of 25 current or former troops were involved as perpetrators or accessories in 23 separate incidents, with some involved just once and a few multiple times.The report said most of the alleged crimes were committed and concealed at a patrol commander level by corporals and sergeants, and that while higher-level troop and squadron commanders had to take some responsibility for the events that happened on their watch, they weren’t primarily to blame.The report paints a picture of a toxic culture in which soldiers were competing against those from other squadrons, accounts of deaths were sanitized or embellished, and many procedures to ensure safety and integrity had broken down.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already announced a special investigator will help pursue possible prosecutions because the workload would overwhelm existing police resources.Many troops are also likely to be stripped of their medals and the defense force will undergo significant structural changes. The report says that where there is credible evidence of unlawful killings, Afghan families should be compensated immediately by Australia without waiting for the criminal cases to proceed.“This will be an important step in rehabilitating Australia’s international reputation, in particular with Afghanistan, and it is simply the right thing to do,” the report states."

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said her office charged Sgt. Vadin Shyshimarin, 21, in the killing of an unarmed 62-year-old civilian who was gunned down while riding a bicycle in February, four days into the war. Shyshimarin, who served with a tank unit, was accused of firing through a car window on the man in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka. Venediktova said the soldier could get up to 15 years in prison. She did not say when the trial would start.       Venediktova’s office has said it has been investigating more than 10,700 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and has identified over 600 suspects. Many of the alleged atrocities came to light last month after Moscow’s forces aborted their bid to capture Kyiv and withdrew from around the capital, exposing mass graves and streets and yards strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha. Residents told of killings, burnings, rape, torture and dismemberment. Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Center for Civil Liberties said the Ukrainian human rights group will be closely following Shyshimarin’s trial to see if it is fair. “It’s very difficult to observe all the rules, norms and neutrality of the court proceedings in wartime,” he said. On the economic front, Ukraine shut down a pipeline that carries Russian gas across the country to homes and industries in Western Europe, marking the first time since the start of the war that Kyiv disrupted the flow westward of one of Moscow’s most lucrative exports. But the immediate effect is likely to be limited, in part because Russia can divert the gas to another pipeline and because Europe relies on a variety of suppliers.       Meanwhile, a Kremlin-installed politician in the southern Kherson region, site of the first major Ukrainian city to fall in the war, said officials there want Russian President Vladimir Putin to make Kherson a “proper region” of Russia — that is, annex it. “The city of Kherson is Russia,” Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration appointed by Moscow, told Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. That raised the possibility that the Kremlin would seek to break off another piece of Ukraine as it tries to salvage an invasion gone awry. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which borders the Kherson region, after a disputed referendum in 2014, a move denounced as illegal and rejected by most of the international community. Kherson, a Black Sea port of roughly 300,000, provides Crimea with access to fresh water and is seen as gateway to wider Russian control over southern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be “up to the residents of the Kherson region after all to decide whether such an appeal should be made or not.” He said any move to annex territory would have to be closely evaluated by legal experts to make sure it is “absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak mocked the notion of Kherson’s annexation, tweeting: “The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play.” Inside Kherson, people have taken to the streets to decry the Russian occupation. But a teacher who gave only her first name, Olga, for fear of Russian retaliation said such protests are impossible now because Moscow’s troops “kidnapped activists and citizens simply for wearing Ukrainian colors or ribbons.” She said “people are scared of talking openly outside their homes” and “everyone walks on the street quickly.” “All people in Kherson are waiting for our troops to come as soon as possible,” she added. “Nobody wants to live in Russia or join Russia.” On the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said a Russian rocket attack targeted an area around Zaporizhzhia, destroying unspecified infrastructure. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The southeastern city has been a refuge for civilians fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Russian forces continued to pound the steel plant that is the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, its defenders said. The Azov Regiment said on social media that Russian forces carried out 38 airstrikes in the previous 24 hours on the grounds of the Azovstal steelworks. The plant has sheltered hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians during a monthslong siege. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine has offered to release Russian prisoners of war if Russia will allow the badly injured fighters to be evacuated. An adviser to the Mariupol mayor said Russian forces have blocked all evacuation routes out of the city. Petro Andriushchenko said there are few apartment buildings fit to live in and little food or drinking water. He said some remaining residents are cooperating with occupying Russian forces in exchange for food. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested Tuesday that Ukraine’s military is gradually pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and a key to Russia’s offensive in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region whose capture the Kremlin says is its main objective. Ukraine is also targeting Russian air defenses and resupply vessels on Snake Island in the Black Sea in an effort to disrupt Moscow’s efforts to expand its control over the coastline, according to the British Ministry of Defense. Separately, Ukraine said it shot down a cruise missile targeting the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Elsewhere, the governor of a Russian region near Ukraine said at least one civilian was killed and six wounded by Ukrainian shelling in the village of Solokhi, near the border. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’s account couldn’t be independently verified, but he said the village will be evacuated. Ukraine’s natural gas pipeline operator said it moved to stop the flow of Russian gas through a compressor station in part of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists because enemy forces were interfering with the station’s operation and siphoning off gas. The hub handles about one-third of Russian gas passing through Ukraine to Western Europe. But analysts said much of the gas can be redirected through another pipeline from Russia that crosses Ukraine, and there were indications that was happening. In any case, Europe also gets natural gas from other pipelines and other countries. It was not clear whether Russia would take any immediate hit, since it has long-term contracts and other ways of transporting gas. Still, the cutoff underscored the broader risk to gas supplies from the war. “Yesterday’s decision is a small preview of what might happen if gas installations are hit by live fire and face the risk of extended downtimes,” said gas analyst Zongqiang Luo at Rystad Energy. In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of stealing Ukrainian grain and trying to sell it on global markets. The ministry estimates Russia may have already stolen up to 500,000 metric tons of grain valued at more than $100 million. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said a ban on sales of semiconductors and other technology to Russia by the West is limiting Russia’s ability to manufacture military equipment. Ukrainians who have found Russian equipment reported that it was “filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo said. ___ Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

I work for Costco and I'm asking this member to put on a mask 'cause that is our company policy.""Last month, Costco announced that, beginning May 4, it would return to regular hours and customers and employees alike would be required to wear face-coverings or masks. At the time of the announcement, some on social media voiced their opposition to wearing masks while shopping.Nevertheless, as BuzzFeed News reported, safety guidelines from Costco have been loosened since May 1.The customer retorted that he's not putting on a mask ""because I woke up in a free country.""Tison, the Costco employee, proceeded to take the customer's cart away, politely wished him a great day several times and informed him that he is ""not welcome here in our warehouse"" and that he needed to leave.The customer then offered up insults to the Costco employee as he walked away and culminated the video saying, ""there he goes, 'cause I'm not a (expletive) sheep.""The Centers for Disease Control has recommended ""wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.""After some social media backlash, the customer posted another video saying, ""I've got every (expletive) right to not wear a mask anywhere because this isn't about the mask – this is about control."" He added, ""I was one of the only people in that store not wearing a mask, which means you're protected from me and I'm protected from you.""This perspective doesn't align with what the CDC has said. In its recommendation, the agency notes: ""We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms ('asymptomatic') and that even those who eventually develop symptoms ('pre-symptomatic') can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity.""Though the CDC's guidelines refer to wearing a cloth face covering as a ""voluntary public health measure,"" Costco has adopted face coverings as mandatory for entrance to the store.In unrelated posts on the Costco (Arvada, CO) Facebook page, users were praising the requirement of masks for customers and employees. Support for Tison has also been pouring from Twitter, including from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who tweeted the video adding: ""Costco has the right to require that customers wear a mask. Businesses have the right to prevent people from spewing saliva droplets in their stores.

How can those who do not have food or a safe place to live stay at home in safety? Being able to comply with the quarantine and working from home is a privilege that not everyone has. A large number of migrants around the world are in a position of risk, both because of increased exposure to the coronavirus and because of factors related to health, economics and access to government assistance. Each migrating population has its own reality and needs, some can be faced in these moments of uncertainty and other scenarios are more worrying. Refugees represent one of the populations most at risk, due to the conditions in the camps, where access to water can be restricted and people must live together in tents that have little space. For example, in Moria camp in Greece, it is difficult to comply with recommendations for social distancing because of the number of people living there on a daily basis. Even for those who are not refugees, quarantines represent the paralysis of a significant part of the commercial sectors, and this situation puts the daily income of many citizens at risk. Depending on the measures in each country, numerous businesses must remain closed, and this leads to some people losing their jobs or receiving lower percentages that are not sufficient for their monthly expenses. Immigrants frequently take jobs in the informal economy, but sales decrease considerably with more restrictive measures. Unable to generate profits, some business owners have put flexible policies in place to help, but others have decided to evict those who fall behind in their rent payments from residences and apartments. On social networks, the number of complaints from people left on the streets has increased. In Peru, for example, some Venezuelans have reported cases of forced evictions, with the fear of having no other place to go. In contrast, others are trying to assist in any way they can, such as a hotel in Spain that opened its doors to immigrants who had no other place to spend the quarantine. In different places around the world, a large number of people are trying to return home. From stranded tourists to migrants who have been destabilized by the situation. Closed borders are a concern for those who want to go home, with debates between waiting and finding the means to return. The border between Colombia and Venezuela was closed in March, thereafter the authorities took steps to allow a limited number of people to pass through each day. Among the more than 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated in recent times because of the serious social, political and economic situation in the South American country, some thousands have decided to return since the pandemic began affecting neighboring countries like Colombia and Peru. With no money in their pockets and with the suspension of public transport due to COVID-19, Venezuelans who try to return do so on foot. History repeats itself in reverse. In the past, many people left Venezuela walking with a small bag, on a journey of days to get from Cucuta to Bogota, or even to other more distant countries. But the situation has changed and without the ability to work, they must return despite the fear caused by the country’s internal problems. India is in a similar situation, but with internal mobility, where workers in large cities were forced to walk home thousands of miles when their jobs were put on hold because of the coronavirus. The journeys are tolerated with inappropriate shoes and little food in their stomachs. In India, a significant number of people leave their villages in order to ensure a better future for themselves. These workers have informal jobs and send almost everything they earn to their families. Living from day to day, the announcement of confinement forced them to make the decision to leave the residences they could not afford and return to the family home. The situation is not promising for populations at risk in different parts of the world. Some governments have attempted to take measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, for example, at the border of Colombia and Venezuela, testing is being carried out to detect those infected. These measures can help prevent further spread of the virus but, in some cases, it is not easy to detect the virus conclusively and this can result in the entry of infected persons. Despite the risks, it is important to support those in need at this time, hoping that precautions are sufficient to avoid the possibility of further infection.

Stuff understands it was a group of students from Palmerston North Boys’ High School’s boarding hostel, College House, who went to the house of another student on Tutaki Road. The group of students allegedly threw eggs and stones at the house, then there was a fight between the group and the student and his father.

Unfortunately, the state of the movie industry being what it is right now, that isn't possible and we all have to wait until next year to see Michael Myers back at it again. But Blumhouse Productions head Jason Blum has promised that, come hell or high water, the upcoming entry in the franchise is coming out next October. During a recent interview for the Welcome to the Blumhouse series and The Craft: Legacy, Jason Blum, who serves as a key producer on Halloween Kills, was asked about a further delay, possibly to 2022. Given the uncertain nature of the world currently, it is a reasonable question. Be that as it may, Blum did not mince words in his response. Here's what he had to say about it. RELATED: John Carpenter Praises Halloween Kills as the 'Quintessential Slasher Film' ""No [laughs]. If this is still going on next Halloween? No, we're not holding it. Halloween Kills is coming out next October come hell or high water, vaccine or no vaccine. It is coming out."" So there you have it. Michael Myers will be back in Haddonfield mixing it up with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. As we've seen recently, moviegoers are, by and large, still hesitant to go to theaters right now. Tenet and The New Mutants did not draw big crowds and what few movies are available are not tempting enough to get most people to take on the risk. It is believed that traditional theaters will not be completely safe until a vaccine is widely available. In the meantime, drive-ins have become a haven for lovers of the cinematic experience.  To that point, there is no telling what the movie industry is going to look like come Halloween 2021. Halloween Kills is coming out next year, Jason Blum is making that quite clear, but that doesn't mean the distribution strategy won't change. 2018's Halloween earned $255 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing slasher in history. It would greatly benefit Universal Pictures and Blumhouse to give the sequel a wide release in as many theaters as possible. But if that isn't feasible, they may have to get creative doing some sort of premium VOD release or something along those lines. But a lot can happen in a year. David Gordon Green is returning to the director's chair for the sequel. Franchise creator John Carpenter is also on board as an executive producer, in addition to doing the score. Carpenter recently called it, ""the quintessential slasher film."" Halloween Kills is currently set to hit theaters on October 15, 2021. Another sequel that will bring this version of the franchise to a close, titled Halloween Ends, is also planned. It is currently scheduled to arrive in October 2022. But meeting that date that will be dependent on getting production squared away by then. We'll be sure to keep you posted as any further details are made available. This news comes to us via Forbes.

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said her office charged Sgt. Vadin Shyshimarin, 21, in the killing of an unarmed 62-year-old civilian who was gunned down while riding a bicycle in February, four days into the war. Shyshimarin, who served with a tank unit, was accused of firing through a car window on the man in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka. Venediktova said the soldier could get up to 15 years in prison. She did not say when the trial would start.       Venediktova’s office has said it has been investigating more than 10,700 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and has identified over 600 suspects. Many of the alleged atrocities came to light last month after Moscow’s forces aborted their bid to capture Kyiv and withdrew from around the capital, exposing mass graves and streets and yards strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha. Residents told of killings, burnings, rape, torture and dismemberment. Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Center for Civil Liberties said the Ukrainian human rights group will be closely following Shyshimarin’s trial to see if it is fair. “It’s very difficult to observe all the rules, norms and neutrality of the court proceedings in wartime,” he said. On the economic front, Ukraine shut down a pipeline that carries Russian gas across the country to homes and industries in Western Europe, marking the first time since the start of the war that Kyiv disrupted the flow westward of one of Moscow’s most lucrative exports. But the immediate effect is likely to be limited, in part because Russia can divert the gas to another pipeline and because Europe relies on a variety of suppliers.       Meanwhile, a Kremlin-installed politician in the southern Kherson region, site of the first major Ukrainian city to fall in the war, said officials there want Russian President Vladimir Putin to make Kherson a “proper region” of Russia — that is, annex it. “The city of Kherson is Russia,” Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration appointed by Moscow, told Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. That raised the possibility that the Kremlin would seek to break off another piece of Ukraine as it tries to salvage an invasion gone awry. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which borders the Kherson region, after a disputed referendum in 2014, a move denounced as illegal and rejected by most of the international community. Kherson, a Black Sea port of roughly 300,000, provides Crimea with access to fresh water and is seen as gateway to wider Russian control over southern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be “up to the residents of the Kherson region after all to decide whether such an appeal should be made or not.” He said any move to annex territory would have to be closely evaluated by legal experts to make sure it is “absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak mocked the notion of Kherson’s annexation, tweeting: “The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play.” Inside Kherson, people have taken to the streets to decry the Russian occupation. But a teacher who gave only her first name, Olga, for fear of Russian retaliation said such protests are impossible now because Moscow’s troops “kidnapped activists and citizens simply for wearing Ukrainian colors or ribbons.” She said “people are scared of talking openly outside their homes” and “everyone walks on the street quickly.” “All people in Kherson are waiting for our troops to come as soon as possible,” she added. “Nobody wants to live in Russia or join Russia.” On the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said a Russian rocket attack targeted an area around Zaporizhzhia, destroying unspecified infrastructure. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The southeastern city has been a refuge for civilians fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Russian forces continued to pound the steel plant that is the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, its defenders said. The Azov Regiment said on social media that Russian forces carried out 38 airstrikes in the previous 24 hours on the grounds of the Azovstal steelworks. The plant has sheltered hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians during a monthslong siege. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine has offered to release Russian prisoners of war if Russia will allow the badly injured fighters to be evacuated. An adviser to the Mariupol mayor said Russian forces have blocked all evacuation routes out of the city. Petro Andriushchenko said there are few apartment buildings fit to live in and little food or drinking water. He said some remaining residents are cooperating with occupying Russian forces in exchange for food. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested Tuesday that Ukraine’s military is gradually pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and a key to Russia’s offensive in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region whose capture the Kremlin says is its main objective. Ukraine is also targeting Russian air defenses and resupply vessels on Snake Island in the Black Sea in an effort to disrupt Moscow’s efforts to expand its control over the coastline, according to the British Ministry of Defense. Separately, Ukraine said it shot down a cruise missile targeting the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Elsewhere, the governor of a Russian region near Ukraine said at least one civilian was killed and six wounded by Ukrainian shelling in the village of Solokhi, near the border. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’s account couldn’t be independently verified, but he said the village will be evacuated. Ukraine’s natural gas pipeline operator said it moved to stop the flow of Russian gas through a compressor station in part of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists because enemy forces were interfering with the station’s operation and siphoning off gas. The hub handles about one-third of Russian gas passing through Ukraine to Western Europe. But analysts said much of the gas can be redirected through another pipeline from Russia that crosses Ukraine, and there were indications that was happening. In any case, Europe also gets natural gas from other pipelines and other countries. It was not clear whether Russia would take any immediate hit, since it has long-term contracts and other ways of transporting gas. Still, the cutoff underscored the broader risk to gas supplies from the war. “Yesterday’s decision is a small preview of what might happen if gas installations are hit by live fire and face the risk of extended downtimes,” said gas analyst Zongqiang Luo at Rystad Energy. In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of stealing Ukrainian grain and trying to sell it on global markets. The ministry estimates Russia may have already stolen up to 500,000 metric tons of grain valued at more than $100 million. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said a ban on sales of semiconductors and other technology to Russia by the West is limiting Russia’s ability to manufacture military equipment. Ukrainians who have found Russian equipment reported that it was “filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo said. ___ Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

222440345,2021-06-13 11:00:58.154292+00:00,http://www.chinanews.com/gj/2021/06-13/9499090.shtml,http://www.chinanews.com/gj/2021/06-13/9499090.shtml,“所有东西都在涨价”背后的美国现实,No description,chinanews.com,   环球深观察丨“所有东西都在涨价”背后的美国现实  生活在纽约的卡梅拉·沙登最近的日子过得越来越紧，最让她发愁的是吃喝问题：她和儿子每周的伙食费从年初的175美元增加到现在的200到250美元；她以前花28至32美元就能买到的一盒牛排现在涨到了45美元。  像沙登这样的美国普通消费者不在少数，他们手头拮据的原因很简单——所有东西都在涨价。  数据显示，美国5月份消费者价格指数（CPI）比4月份上涨0.6%，比去年同期上涨5%，这是自2008年以来最大的12个月通胀幅度。  4月核心通胀率（不包括波动较大的能源和食品价格）涨幅为0.9%，较去年同期上涨3.8%，是自1992年以来核心通胀率12个月最大涨幅，也远远高于美联储2%的年度物价上涨目标。  通胀不仅坑了百姓，也阻碍了经济复苏  据《华尔街日报》报道，越来越多的美国企业开始将原材料和工资成本的上涨转嫁给消费者。  通用磨坊公司首席执行官杰夫·哈蒙德在最近的一次投资者会议上说：“我们看到的通胀压力是显著的，这可能比我们过去十年看到的还要高。”  美国全国独立企业联合会发布的一项调查显示，约48%的小企业表示他们在5月份提高了平均销售价格，这是1981年以来的最高比例。  通胀压力不仅在压榨消费者，也给美国经济从大萧条中复苏带来了风险。  有经济学家指出，其中一个风险是，美联储最终将通过“过快”提高利率来应对日益加剧的通胀，从而破坏经济复苏。  美联储主席鲍威尔曾多次表示，通胀只是“暂时的”，随着供应瓶颈得以消除，零部件和商品会恢复正常流动。  但穆迪分析首席经济学家马克·赞迪分析称，因为疫情对供应链的破坏非常严重，所以物价飙升的幅度可能更大、时间也更长。  一些经济学家担心，如果物价上涨过快，在高位停留的时间过长，对物价持续上涨的预期将根深蒂固。反过来，这可能会加剧人们对加薪的要求，就有可能引发上世纪70年代困扰美国经济的那种情况：工资——物价螺旋上升。  与此同时，美国劳动力市场出现了一些滑稽的情况：5月新增55.9万个就业岗位，但仍比疫情前少760万个。一方面是失业率仍然居高不下，另一方面，很多迫切需要招聘的企业，即便提高工资以吸引工人，还是无法找到足够的人手填补创纪录数量的职位空缺。  对于为什么会有这么多人选择不工作？经济学家们提出了各种各样的解释，其中之一就是慷慨的失业福利。  许多企业认为，联邦政府每周额外向失业工人提供300美元的援助，会打消他们找工作的积极性；有些人从失业救济金中获得的收入比他们从工作中获得的还要多。  西部银行首席经济学家安德森指出，如果新劳动力不能很快重新进入劳动力市场，劳动力短缺可能会加剧，从而加剧整个经济领域的工资和通胀压力。而如果工资持续上涨，企业就会忍不住以涨价的方式将劳动力成本的上升转嫁给消费者，这可能会导致比预期更久的高通胀，从而形成一种恶性循环。  党派极化：政府想干什么都难  就业问题又让民主党的政治对手抓住了把柄。  连续两个月的就业报告都逊于经济师预期，共和党抨击拜登政府包括联邦失业救济金在内的庞大支出令失业者没有重返工作岗位的动力。  在这种前所未有的经济形势下，预测未来几个月通货膨胀趋势的专家们也存在分歧。  据美国“商业内幕”网站报道，共和党人及一些温和的民主党人最近加倍强调，拜登政府的大额支出可能导致通胀螺旋式上升。  但美国财政部长耶伦上月底表示，通货膨胀率升高“不是病”，政府应继续投资基础设施。  然而，即便想做到耶伦希望的那样毫无顾忌地加大财政支出，也不是容易的事。  为了应对疫情和刺激经济，拜登政府上台后不惜代价地列出一张又一张“烧钱”的财政支出账单，包括最近的两项总额超过4万亿美元的基建和就业计划以及家庭保障计划，其中基建和就业计划原计划耗资2.3万亿美元，但遭到共和党全员反对。  当地时间10日下午，一个由两党各5名参议员组成的跨党派小组宣布就拜登的基础设施建设计划达成一项“折衷框架协议”，该协议包括5790亿美元的新支出，用于未来8年总计1.2万亿美元的基础设施融资。  在两党存在严重分歧的情况下，这份初步协议是否能够让足够多的议员满意仍然是未知数。  在目前美国的政治环境下，民主党在参议院并未占多数，任何新的公共工程支出计划都必须在所有民主党参议员都支持的情况下，吸引至少10名共和党参议员的赞成票才能推进，这肯定是一个不小的挑战。  中国国际问题研究院研究员滕建群指出，美国政治对立和党派极化的现实决定了政府决策的举步维艰，而到头来受到伤害的永远是美国的经济和百姓。  滕建群：“美国的政治这种对立，特别是党争，已经使美国的经济发展遇到了极大的阻力。任何一个政策不管好坏，只要是对方党派提出来的计划，那么本党肯定会做出一致的反对，没有是非曲直之分。所以在这样一个极端对立的状况下，不管是民主党的领导人还是共和党的，都很难把自己的理念和计划付诸实施，这就是美国现在的现实政治，从而左右了美国经济的发展，左右了美国社会的稳定。”  撰稿丨单立娟                
203073846,2020-05-21 00:56:35.404888+00:00,http://globalcomment.com/facing-the-coronavirus-away-from-home/,http://globalcomment.com/facing-the-coronavirus-away-from-home/,Facing the coronavirus away from home,No description,globalcomment.com,"      While all human beings are currently threatened by COVID-19, it is true to say that there is more vulnerability in certain populations. How can those who do not have food or a safe place to live stay at home in safety? Being able to comply with the quarantine and working from home is a privilege that not everyone has. A large number of migrants around the world are in a position of risk, both because of increased exposure to the coronavirus and because of factors related to health, economics and access to government assistance. Each migrating population has its own reality and needs, some can be faced in these moments of uncertainty and other scenarios are more worrying. Refugees represent one of the populations most at risk, due to the conditions in the camps, where access to water can be restricted and people must live together in tents that have little space. For example, in Moria camp in Greece, it is difficult to comply with recommendations for social distancing because of the number of people living there on a daily basis. Even for those who are not refugees, quarantines represent the paralysis of a significant part of the commercial sectors, and this situation puts the daily income of many citizens at risk. Depending on the measures in each country, numerous businesses must remain closed, and this leads to some people losing their jobs or receiving lower percentages that are not sufficient for their monthly expenses. Immigrants frequently take jobs in the informal economy, but sales decrease considerably with more restrictive measures. Unable to generate profits, some business owners have put flexible policies in place to help, but others have decided to evict those who fall behind in their rent payments from residences and apartments. On social networks, the number of complaints from people left on the streets has increased. In Peru, for example, some Venezuelans have reported cases of forced evictions, with the fear of having no other place to go. In contrast, others are trying to assist in any way they can, such as a hotel in Spain that opened its doors to immigrants who had no other place to spend the quarantine. In different places around the world, a large number of people are trying to return home. From stranded tourists to migrants who have been destabilized by the situation. Closed borders are a concern for those who want to go home, with debates between waiting and finding the means to return. The border between Colombia and Venezuela was closed in March, thereafter the authorities took steps to allow a limited number of people to pass through each day. Among the more than 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated in recent times because of the serious social, political and economic situation in the South American country, some thousands have decided to return since the pandemic began affecting neighboring countries like Colombia and Peru. With no money in their pockets and with the suspension of public transport due to COVID-19, Venezuelans who try to return do so on foot. History repeats itself in reverse. In the past, many people left Venezuela walking with a small bag, on a journey of days to get from Cucuta to Bogota, or even to other more distant countries. But the situation has changed and without the ability to work, they must return despite the fear caused by the country’s internal problems. India is in a similar situation, but with internal mobility, where workers in large cities were forced to walk home thousands of miles when their jobs were put on hold because of the coronavirus. The journeys are tolerated with inappropriate shoes and little food in their stomachs. In India, a significant number of people leave their villages in order to ensure a better future for themselves. These workers have informal jobs and send almost everything they earn to their families. Living from day to day, the announcement of confinement forced them to make the decision to leave the residences they could not afford and return to the family home. The situation is not promising for populations at risk in different parts of the world. Some governments have attempted to take measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, for example, at the border of Colombia and Venezuela, testing is being carried out to detect those infected. These measures can help prevent further spread of the virus but, in some cases, it is not easy to detect the virus conclusively and this can result in the entry of infected persons. Despite the risks, it is important to support those in need at this time, hoping that precautions are sufficient to avoid the possibility of further infection.

The Artistic Director Finghin Collins, who lives near New Ross, will be on hand. In his introduction to this year’s festival he said: “This year, in a nod towards world events, we look towards the East and welcome pianists from both Georgia and Ukraine.” Making her Irish début is Tamara Licheli from Tbilisi –– and Dmytro Choni from Kyiv – winner of the Paloma O’Shea International Piano Competition in Santander, Spain in 2018 – is also performing. They are two very different artists who will play music from their own countries, as well as familiar classics by Mozart, Brahms, Schumann, Rachmaninov and more. The British pianist Jonathan Plowright makes a welcome return to Ireland and the Swiss pianist François-Xavier Poizat makes his Irish début. The wonderful Albion Quartet from the UK will join with three of pianists to present two relatively unknown piano quintets (by Amy Beach and Juliusz Zarebski) and the more familiar Shostakovich Piano Quintet.  Young Irish pianist Máire Carroll will perform in the Friday morning slot, inspiring secondary school music students from across the region. Jazz Piano Day will feature Greg Felton and his trio Origin Story, and the much-lauded US pianist Craig Taborn who will dazzle in the evening concert .He is looking forward to presenting extracts from his latest CD release “The Bright Day is Done” at the Late Night Concert.  On behalf of everyone on the committee of the New Ross Piano Festival Connie tantrum said she wants to thank its principal funders, the Arts Council and Wexford County Council. “Their support has been unwavering. We also thank our many Friends for their continued support.” Maire Carroll is performing on the Friday at noon. She is known for her innovative programming and will be chatting and playing to second level music students prior to the concert. The session with the students is one of the four strands of the festival involving young people. On the Wednesday, Sept 21st, a Young Pianist Concert takes place in St Mary’s Church. It only costs €5 to come and listen to about 20 dedicated piano students from the south east, aged between eight and 19, as they perform on the grand Steinway D. On the Thursday the Library will host three sessions of primary school children from the area as they meet Sinead Crowley, a music teacher in WIT who plays the piano for them and describes its workings. On the Saturday Jonathan Plowright gives a masterclass to two advanced piano students – both at third level. This takes place in the Pastoral Centre on Michael Street and is free for the public, though places are limited. Thursday is Jazz Piano Day during the festival, and there is an amazing jazz pianist, Craig Taborn, coming from America. He has played in Dublin before, and has got rave reviews from jazz buffs. He will play in St Mary’s Church at 8 p.m. on the Thursday. There will also be a lunch-time concert in St Mary’s performed by the jazz trio, Origin Story, led by Greg Felton on the piano, Cormac O'Brien (double bass), and Matthew Jacobson (drums).  Felton is a highly accomplished performer, improviser, composer and educator from Dublin, and lectures in DCU. As well as performing with the trio, he will play two short and free sessions in the Dunbrody Captain’s Table Café at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. He has found out recently  to his delight that his grandfather was the organist in St Mary’s Church where he will now be playing jazz.

Managing partner Eric Holoman will take over her duties as the club searches for a replacement.  “On behalf of ownership and the entire Sparks organization, I’d like to thank Penny Toler for a successful and historic tenure with the organization,” Holoman said. “Penny is a foundational figure in the growth of the WNBA and helped lead our franchise to perennial playoff success and multiple titles. We wish her nothing but the best moving forward.”  The Sparks said in a statement that a national search for a new general manager would begin immediately.  Toler played for the Sparks from 1997-99. During her tenure as general manager the club won WNBA titles in 2001, 2002 and 2016 while qualifying for the playoffs 18 times.  She scored the first basket in WNBA history and averaged 10.0 points, 4.0 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 88 games, 62 of which she started.  The 5-foot-8 guard from Washington, D.C., played at Long Beach State and became the 49ers’ career leader in assists and free-throw percentage at the time. She was the conference player of the year in 1988 and co-player of the year in 1989.  Dan Loumena has worked myriad jobs at the Los Angeles Times since joining the staff in 1996, including as a page designer, copy editor, assignment editor and Web producer. Loumena was part of the first group of print journalists at The Times to delve full time into the wonders of the website, helping the department move into the digital-first, round-the-clock coverage.  Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg could forfeit a guaranteed four years and $100 million in search of a better deal on the open market this offseason.  Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay finally got running back Todd Gurley into something resembling an early rhythm, against the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.  Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw will start Game 2 of the NLDS against the Nationals, and if the series goes five games, he’ll be rested enough to pitch again.  Dabo Swinney makes $9.3 million per year as coach of Clemson’s two-time national champion football team. So you might think he would like to see his players paid for their work. And they are, he says. With an education.  "

So maybe it was fitting that when they rallied from a four-run deficit and won a game that maybe they shouldn’t have, a 5-4 victory over the Pirates, they celebrated in a manner so humble, the hero called it “boring.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Nelson Cruz smacked a 400-foot single to the center field warning track, scoring Jorge Polanco from third base with the winning run and setting off a joyous but ridiculous hullabaloo of pantomime high-fives and make-believe hugs and socially distant Gatorade throwing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Boring. It’s no fun,” Cruz said after the pandemic-adjusted festivities. “Hopefully next year, we celebrate the good way.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           They are certainly winning in unusual ways. This was their fourth consecutive victory, and even though they fell behind from the game’s first pitch, the Twins somehow improved to 8-2 one-sixth of the way into this bizarre season. And check out the factors that had to go right:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A wayward throw from the outfield. A fastball that landed 2 feet in front of the plate. The new three-batter rule for relievers, and some savvy plate discipline by a hitter in an 0-for-8 slump. And ultimately, Pirates manager Derek Shelton’s decision not to intentionally walk Cruz, a fearsome hitter Shelton watched lead the Twins to 101 victories last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Oh, that Swiss-army-knife approach served the Twins well on the run-prevention side, too: Did anyone forecast a Lewis Thorpe/Jorge Alcala/Matt Wisler combo holding the Pirates in check until closer Taylor Rogers finished it up?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      “We’re not going to shy away from any of our guys, and our guys have not shied away once we’ve put them in the game,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “They take the ball and they’ve made great pitch after great pitch.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Well, not Thorpe’s first one — a down-the-middle fastball Cole Tucker smashed into the bleachers. After four innings, the Twins trailed 4-0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Then things got wild. Or at least, Pittsburgh did. Mitch Garver drew a one-out walk in the sixth off Derek Holland, moved up to second on a groundout and scored when Cruz drilled a single to right, his 13th RBI of the season, and when Heredia’s throw arched into the air as if filled with helium, Cruz moved up to second base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Suddenly, the Twins’ dugout was alive. Miguel Sano took a 3-2 curve for his first walk of the season. Max Kepler doubled to right-center, scoring Cruz and Sano. Shelton removed Holland for lefthander Miguel Del Pozo, who immediately walked Marwin Gonzalez and Jake Cave to load the bases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Stuck under baseball’s new three-batter rule with the too-wild lefthander for another batter, a righthander — Byron Buxton, batting .071 — Shelton watched as Buxton took three straight balls, the third of which bounced in the dirt and past catcher Jacob Stallings, scoring Kepler with the tying run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    That set up the ninth-inning heroics off former Twins prospect Nick Burdi. Polanco led off as a pinch hitter, and fouled off three close pitches before lining another one to left. He moved to second on a passed ball, and Garver walked. Luis Arraez advanced both runners on a fly ball, bringing up Cruz with first base open. Shelton had Burdi pitch to him. Big mistake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      “I thought maybe they were going to pitch around me, but I was pretty confident with my approach,” Cruz said. “And it paid off.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It did on a 1-1 fastball that Cruz crushed over Tucker’s head. Polanco scored, the fake cheers roared, and the no-touch party began.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Rocco yelled at us, ‘Hey, no contact.

US banking giant Citi’s decision to exit Mexican consumer banking by selling its Banamex unit has triggered worries not just about the employees but also its treasure trove of art. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wants the Banamex collection – comprising hundreds of artworks as well as colonial-era buildings acquired over decades – to remain in Mexico. “We’re talking about art collections from the best artists, painters in Mexico and the world,” he said. Lopez Obrador has urged Mexican investors to buy Banamex, one of the country’s top banks. Potential buyers include Mexico’s richest man, Carlos Slim; controversial businessman Ricardo Salinas Pliego; and Carlos Hank Gonzalez, who runs the Mexican bank Banorte, he said.

Photo: Alfredo Estrella/AFP The appeal comes at a time when Lopez Obrador’s government is seeking to prevent Mexican artefacts from being auctioned abroad. The Banamex collection “should become national property for its preservation”, said Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who believes it would be recompense for bank bailouts by the government in the 1990s. ‘Incalculable value’ Banamex is one of Mexico’s oldest banks. It began operating in 1884 and its art collection has not stopped growing, even when it was sold to Citigroup in 2001. A visitor looks at ‘Fruits of the Earth’ by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Photo: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP The collection has an “incalculable value”, said Hilda Trujillo, a specialist in 20th-century Mexican art and former director of the Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera Anahuacalli museums in Mexico City. “It should be treated with the utmost care as part of the country’s patrimonial and artistic heritage,” she added. The artworks “are an integral and indivisible part” of the sale, so whoever buys the commercial banking unit must also acquire the collection, said Alberto Gomez Alcala, a director at Banamex. He declined to put a value on the artwork. “The number in pesos and cents does not matter. That’s why we say that it is invaluable, and we’re sure that it will continue to be so,” he told journalists. The collection includes works such as Vendedora de alcatraces (Calla Lily Vendor), which Diego Rivera, one of the greatest Mexican muralists of the 20th century, painted in 1942. The painting occupies a prominent place inside the Foro Valparaiso, an 18th-century building located in the heart of Mexico City that also belongs to the bank. A woman takes a picture of a 1931 painting by Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros called ‘Mujer con metate’ (Woman with mortar). Photo: Alfredo Estrella/AFP It is accompanied by equally important 20th-century works such as Frida Kahlo’s Los frutos de la tierra (Fruits of the Earth, 1938) and David Alfaro Siqueiros’s Mujer con metate (Woman with Metate, 1931). The works date back even further to the 19th century, including landscapes of the Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl volcanoes, painted by the artist Jose Maria Velasco. “It is without doubt one of the most important collections recreating the history of painting in Mexico,” said Angelica Velazquez, director of the Institute of Aesthetic Research at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “It would seem very difficult to me for the next owners to be insensitive to the value of the collection for the country,” she said.Independent journalism costs money.

However, due to some “errors”, it has preliminarily indicated the net loss for the year should be up to $30.6m. Due to the identified errors, Gan said it would be unable to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time without “unreasonable effort or expense”.  Gan said it needed more time to complete its annual report as some unaudited financial statements “should be restated and no longer relied upon”.  Gan, whose chief executive is Dermot Smurfit Jnr, added that management had determined a “material weakness” existed in its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of three quarterly periods in 2021. This related to the “completeness and accuracy of accounting” for software development costs and the timing of revenue recognition where performance obligations were ongoing, resulting in misstatements. “The company’s preliminary analysis indicates that, after adjusting for these errors, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, will be between approximately $30m and $30.6m,” read the filing.  “No assurances can be given that the additional review and procedures in connection with the issuance of the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, will not lead to information that may require further adjustments that would negatively impact the previously announced results of operations.”   In Gan’s preliminary results announcement, the company said revenue for 2021 was $125.4m, up from $35.2m the previous year. Gan said its growth was driven by its Coolbet acquisition in January 2021.      "

Die Regierungschefs der Autoländer sprechen darüber. Volkswagen hat sich vor den Beratungen der Ministerpräsidenten von Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Württemberg über mögliche Auto-Kaufprämien in der Krise für eine weitreichende Förderung ausgesprochen.  Man werde sich dafür starkmachen, „dass die Politik Geld für diesen Impulsstoß bereitstellt“, erklärte VW-Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh am Mittwoch in einem Brief an die Mitarbeiter. „Wir wissen, dass wir damit nach Steuermitteln rufen“, heißt es in dem Schreiben, das der dpa vorliegt. „Aber wir wissen auch, dass sich dieses Geld für unsere gesamte Gesellschaft klug anlegen ließe und sich so gleich mehrfach rechnen könnte – nämlich ökonomisch, ökologisch und sozial.“ Generelle Kaufprämie oder Begrenzung auf E-Autos Die Regierungschefs der drei Autoländer – Stephan Weil (SPD), Markus Söder (CSU) und Winfried Kretschmann (Grüne) – wollen sich am Nachmittag zusammenschalten. Weil hatte am Montag zum Wiederanlauf des VW-Stammwerks Wolfsburg angekündigt, ein denkbares Prämienmodell zu prüfen: „Uns ist bewusst, dass wir eine schnelle Entscheidung brauchen.“ VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess forderte „baldige kraftvolle Maßnahmen“. Söder sagte der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“: „Ich bin für eine sehr umfassende Strategie, wie wir der Automobilindustrie helfen.“ Nach den Vorstellungen des VW-Betriebsrats sollte ein Fördermodell unter anderem eine „Impuls-Prämie“ für Neuwagenkäufe inklusive Leasing umfassen, die auch für moderne Verbrenner gilt und über „einen klar begrenzten Zeitraum“ läuft. Sie sollte ähnlich hoch sein wie die „Abwrackprämie“ in der Finanzkrise 2009 und sich auch auf junge Gebrauchtwagen bis zum Alter von einem Jahr erstrecken. Abwrackprämie zusätzlich Zudem möchte Osterloh eine „zusätzliche Abwrackprämie obendrauf“, die es für verschrottete Altautos der Abgasnormen Euro-3 und Euro-4 gibt. Die deutschen Hersteller sollten sich nach Meinung von VW einig sein, die staatlichen Mittel „je nach zugesagter Summe womöglich sogar zu verdoppeln, zumindest aber die Wechselkosten zu übernehmen“. Daneben solle der CO2-Ausstoß als Bemessungsgrundlage für die Kfz-Steuer stärker berücksichtigt werden.  Söder hatte in der vergangenen Woche erklärt, er wolle sich mit seinen beiden Kollegen aus Hannover und Stuttgart zusammensetzen, um etwa über ökologische Prämienmodelle nachzudenken und gerade der neuen Generation von Motoren und Autos nach der Phase des Durchhaltens eine Möglichkeit zu geben. Die Autobauer hatten wegen des Nachfrageeinbruchs und unterbrochener Lieferketten ihre Werke über mehrere Wochen schließen müssen – drastische Umsatzrückgänge sind die Folge. Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze (SPD) befürwortet neue Hilfen für die Autoindustrie, wenn sich die Förderung „auf klimaschonende Fahrzeuge“ konzentriert. (dpa)   Eine Buchempfehlung vom Verlag der Epoch Times Wenn der Staat eine aktive Rolle in der Wirtschaft spielt, hat jede Aktion einen Dominoeffekt auf den Markt. Neue Richtlinien und Gesetze können ganze Branchen verändern und viele Unternehmen und Investoren von den Entscheidungen der Regierung abhängig machen. Der Staat, der traditionell nur Gesetze verabschiedete und durchsetzte, ist dadurch ein führender Akteur in der Wirtschaft geworden.  Der Staat ist wie ein Schiedsrichter, der bei einem Fußballspiel auch noch zum Spieler wird: Er kontrolliert und reguliert das Kapital in einer Wirtschaft, die früher privat war und ersetzt damit die „unsichtbare Hand“ durch die „sichtbare Hand“. Es gibt mindestens zwei Hauptfolgen der umfangreichen staatlichen Eingriffe. Erstens erweitert sich die Macht des Staates hinsichtlich seiner Rolle und seines Umfangs. Regierungsbeamte entwickeln zunehmend Überheblichkeit hinsichtlich ihrer Fähigkeit, in die Wirtschaft einzugreifen und den Staat die Rolle des Retters spielen zu lassen. Auch nach der Bewältigung einer Krise behält die Regierung für gewöhnlich ihre erweiterten Befugnisse und Funktionen bei – wie im Kapitel 9 des Buches „Wie der Teufel die Welt beherrscht“ analysiert wird.  Zweitens führt der Interventionismus zu mehr Abhängigkeit von der Regierung. Wenn die Menschen auf Herausforderungen stoßen oder wenn der freie Markt nicht die Vorteile bieten kann, die sie sich wünschen, werden sie sich für mehr staatliche Eingriffe einsetzen, um ihre Forderungen erfüllt zu bekommen.

Last month, the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) proposed a phased approach to healthcare workers who opt not to take the Covid-19 vaccine, starting with the provision of information, one-to-one conversations, testing and additional PPE.

This would be enough to fully vaccinate 2.45 million people each year, and Ireland will have the option of buying an additional 9.8 million doses in the same period.                                                                                                                                                                                                         BoostersThe Government said it is likely boosters will be needed for a “very high proportion of the population” to combat variants and deal with waning immunity. Jabs will also likely be extended to under-16s. Cabinet was told there are currently 860 trained and available vaccinators, with 450 needed in May. Just over 1.6 million vaccines have been given out up to May 2nd, Ministers were told on Tuesday. Thirty of 38 vaccination centres are now up and running, with the remainder due to open by May 10th. Between 220,000 and 240,000 vaccines will be given this week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Elsewhere, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is to consult the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) on the latest changes proposed to the vaccine programme. The HSE has proposed a plan that will stick to the age-based approach, but offer vaccines to younger people currently generally recommended only for the over-50s.                                                                                                                                                                                                        With vaccination an opt-in process, the HSE does not know how many staff have refused inoculation. It says over 90 per cent of frontline healthcare workers have taken up the offer of vaccination.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Some healthcare workers have said they wish to choose which vaccine they take, but the HSE had told unions this is not possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                         Patients are entitled to ask about the vaccination status of a healthcare worker, but there is no obligation on the member of staff to disclose what is regarded as sensitive personal health information.                                                                                                                                                                                                        Although cases of Covid-19 among healthcare workers have plummeted since mass vaccination started, 146 cases were reported in this cohort in the second half of April.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called for arming teachers. But Miller has been in a school shooting, and putting the onus on educators to prevent future massacres misses the point, he says.                        ""Preparedness isn't really about training,"" Miller says. ""It's about giving people some kind of out — making people feel like they're doing the work of making gun violence less, when really, it's merely performance.""                  Recently, Miller posted a video to TikTok about his experiences in school-shooting preparedness. It quickly went viral, owing in particular to its creator's bluntness.                   ""I really want to talk about why preparedness,"" he shrugs, ""is a myth.""                  Miller, who is now an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, was in his first year of graduate school at Austin's University of Texas in 2010 when a student brought an AK-47 to the Perry-Castañeda Library on campus.                         The former UT students says all preparation went out the window when Tooley emerged from a bus wearing a dark suit and ski mask and began firing his rifle into the air and at a nearby church.                        ""You memorize the actions you're supposed to take and you don't really critically assess those actions until the moment you're hearing gunshots,"" he says.                                                  Once Miller and those around him heard the first gunshots, he says, everyone froze. They didn't know if it was fireworks, or a bus backfiring. Since they couldn't see the gunman but could hear his shots, he says they were immobilized in not even knowing which direction to run or where to hide.                  ""When you're in that situation, you either don't think about [preparedness steps], or suddenly all of the absurdity of the advice they give is clarified,"" Miller says. ""Because a lot of times, it doesn't come from people who've been in that situation.""                        Tooley ended his assault by fatally shooting himself inside the library without harming anyone else. But since that day, Miller has thought about that nightmarish scenario every time he steps foot inside a classroom whether he wants to or not.                                               One proposed solution that Miller takes offense with — as have some members of the Texas American Federation of Teachers — is arming and training classroom personnel with firearms. The notion relies heavily on huge lifts from teachers to not only physically operate a gun, but to also have the razor-sharp mental acuity to vacillate between educator and armed guard in a split second.                        ""Think of a teacher who spends hours of their own time decorating their room to make it a safe space for students,"" he says. ""Suddenly that teacher needs to kill one of their students or a student they might know. That is absurd.""                  Miller also says that some of the preparedness exercises don't take into consideration people who are non-white or disabled, noting that running toward law enforcement could pose a risk for students of color.                  Recently he learned about a $400,000 system that fills hallways with smoke during an active shooting for protection.                  ""Even then, most school systems — especially those that serve the marginalized — wouldn't be able to afford those kinds of things anyway,"" Miller says. ""So it's not really a sustainable solution.""                        This is not to say that people shouldn't try to prepare for the next mass shooting, Miller says, even if it's a bit like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.                   While teaching at the University of Georgia, Miller began wearing a belt to class just in case he needed to tie it around the door hinge to keep out a gunman. That tiny bit of preparedness may not have done a thing in the moment to prevent a shooting in his classroom, but the ritual made him feel better.                  ""It's that thing that we all feel like we should do, [and] we probably should do, but maybe it won't actually make any difference,"" Miller says. ""But we still do it.""     "

The finance ministry disagrees and President Vladimir Putin has called on authorities to find a consensus.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 on Friday that he hoped disagreements could be ironed out and a bill regulating cryptocurrencies passed by the end of the year. He said the government would take the final decision.""I hope that, in the best-case scenario, it could be passed in the spring session,"" Siluanov said, though he acknowledged that broader debates may prolong its passage.Siluanov said his ministry proposed identifying crypto traders, which he said would separate the ""white"" market from the ""grey"" market.Giving law enforcement the power to trace money flows and transactions may diminish one of cryptocurrencies' major selling points - their anonymity.""The Russian government...appears to have taken the position that crypto assets are here to stay and is contemplating legislation with the aim of bringing the industry 'out of the shadows' and creating an opportunity for legal business,"" said David Henderson, senior associate at Browne Jacobson.A document seen by Reuters, however, shows the central bank does not support the ministry's proposals and wants an outright ban on the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrencies.The finance ministry and central bank did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.Andrey Kladov, former cryptocurrency expert at Russia's Internet Initiatives Development Fund and now engaged in digital banking in South Africa, said their diametrically opposed views could significantly hinder market development, giving time for the grey market to become even greyer.""A prohibitionist stance on it is absolutely useless, like banning umbrellas because 50 years ago someone killed a man with an umbrella,"" Kladov said. ""Everyone has umbrellas and every fifth or 10th person has cryptocurrency.""The central bank estimates the annual volume of cryptocurrency transactions in Russia at about $5 billion.In spite of the dispute, Siluanov said his ministry was working with the central bank to ensure that crypto assets did not appear on banks' balance sheets.(Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Christina Fincher)Vladimir PutinPresident of RussiaAnton SiluanovRussian Minister of Finance and First Deputy Prime Minister"

That was to have changed Saturday, when a long-awaited call was to have finally taken place after getting Russian government approval. But the day came and went without any contact, leaving an anguished Cherelle Griner to wonder what went wrong and to suspect at least initially that Russian authorities had thwarted the call.On Monday, she said she learned from her wife's lawyers a more distressing truth: Brittney Griner had actually tried to call 11 times over a period of several hours, dialing a number she'd been given at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, which the couple had been told would then patch the call through to Cherelle Griner in Phoenix. But each time, the call went unanswered because the desk at the embassy where the phone rang was apparently unstaffed on Saturday.The State Department said Monday that ""we deeply regret that Brittney Griner was unable to speak with her wife because of a logistical error."" The department reiterated that it has no higher priority than the safety of Americans overseas and that it remains in regular contact with families of hostages and wrongful detainees.Brittney Griner, a seven-time WNBA All-Star who plays for the Phoenix Mercury, was detained at a Russian airport on Feb. 17 after authorities there said a search of her bag revealed vape cartridges containing cannabis oil.The State Department in May designated her as wrongfully detained, moving her case under the supervision of its Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, effectively the government's chief hostage negotiator. Russian state-run news agency Tass reported last week that her detention had been extended until July 3.

Griner's wife, Cherelle Griner, has not heard the WNBA star's voice even once in the four months since her arrest in Moscow.

The filing marks the latest development in their ongoing legal feud, which began when Kesha initially sued the producer, real name Lukasz Gottwald, in 2014 and claimed he had sexually assaulted and emotionally abused her. According to court documents via The Hollywood Repoter, a damages model drawn up by the producer’s financial expert, Arthur Erk, alleges there were lost business opportunities, with particular emphasis on how the original rape accusation in 2014 allegedly cost Dr Luke income from producing Katy Perry’s most recent albums. Erk notes that Dr. Luke earned $26.7million (£19.5million) from working on Perry’s first three albums and says it is reasonable that he would have earned $11.65million (£8.5million) more on her next three. His overall calculation is $46,253,672 (£33,70,363) in damages, including a projection of lost revenue through to 2024. Kesha CREDIT: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for dcp But Kesha’s own expert, Louis Dudney, is refuting the claims and criticised Erk for failing to look more deeply into the issue of causation. While Erk measures how Dr Luke’s career has stalled in general, Dudney argues there may have been damage from accusations before Kesha accused him publicly. He also alleges the economic damages analysis from Erk is “speculative and unreliable.” Defending Erk’s work, Dr Luke’s lawyers claim there is no authoritative standard preventing an expert from assuming causation and that Dudney should be precluded from providing this critique at trial. They also argue that Dudney failed to do his own economic model and he has a lack of experience in the music industry. In addition, they criticised some of the opinions he offered at deposition, including that another producer, Max Martin, was largely responsible for Dr Luke’s success. New York Justice Jennifer Schecter will oversee a hearing tomorrow (October 28) where both sides will make their respective arguments about evidence and testimony at the forthcoming trial. A firm date for the main trial is yet to be set. Back in April, Kesha was denied an appeal of a legal ruling that she defamed Dr. Luke, after the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the producer does not qualify as a “public figure”. However, in July, a new ruling stated that the producer will have to prove that Kesha made her initial claims against him with malicious intent. The ruling, from New York Supreme Court Justice Schecter, also stated that Kesha will have the right to file a counterclaim to Gottwald’s defamation suit. "

(PRWEB)                                 January 11, 2022                              “What Is Your Truth?: Building a Strong Foundation on the Word of God”: an inspiring opportunity for spiritual growth. “What Is Your Truth?: Building a Strong Foundation on the Word of God” is the creation of published author Beverly Butts, a loving daughter and sister who earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services Counseling from Old Dominion University. Butts shares, “Truth is the Word of God (the Bible), which tells us the will of God. God wants everyone to be saved and to fully understand the truth. To be saved is a requirement to get into heaven. Understanding the truth is a requirement to renew your mind, to be transformed, to receive spiritual revelation, and to activate the power of God in your life. Acquiring an understanding of the truth allows you as a Christian to build a relationship with God, his son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. What Is Your Truth? will challenge you to evaluate your mindset, your spiritual growth, your obedience to God, and your walk as a disciple. “The objectives of What Is Your Truth? are the following:    Help Christians learn who they are in Christ.    Encourage all Christians to discover the truth, which is the only way to obtain victory and deliverance from the flesh, the world, and the devil.   Encourage all Christians to apply the principles from the Word of God to everyday living. “I pray that What Is Your Truth? will set you free from deception and allow the Word of God to become rooted in your heart.” Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Beverly Butts’s new book challenges readers to release the deceptions of worldly influence and trust in God. Butts writes in hopes of encouraging new and established believers to evaluate and strengthen their bond with God’s Word. Consumers can purchase “What Is Your Truth?: Building a Strong Foundation on the Word of God” at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.

La vittima ricoverata in ospedale con una ferita alla fronte: guarirà in dieci giorni",roma.corriere.it," Sorprende la ex insieme con il nuovo compagno nella loro abitazione a San Basilio e accoltella lui dopo essere entrato in casa da una porta finestra. Un tunisino di 31 anni  stato arrestato per tentato omicidio dai carabinieri della compagnia Montesacro e della stazione San Basilio intervenuti mercoled sera in un appartamento in via Filottrano. La vittima, un romano di 33 anni,  stata ricoverata in ospedale per una ferita da taglio alla fronte, per fortuna non grave: secondo i medici dell’ospedale Sandro Pertini il giovane guarir in una decina di giorni.   L’aggressione  stata portata a termine sotto gli occhi della donna, di 28 anni, che ha chiamato i soccorsi. Da tempo la sua relazione con il tunisino era finita ma lui non si rassegnava e continuava a presentarsi davanti casa. Come ha fatto l’altra sera, suonando ripetutamente al citofono. A un certo punto poi, non ottenendo alcuna risposta, il 31enne ha deciso di passare all’azione e, armato con un coltellaccio da cucina con la lama di trenta centimetri, ha fatto irruzione nell’appartamento sorprendendo la coppia: il romano ha cercato di opporre resistenza, ma  stato colpito da un fendente che solo per un caso non lo ha raggiunto al volto. Il tunisino si  poi dato alla fuga a piedi, ma  stato presto rintracciato dalle pattuglie dei carabinieri: davanti agli investigatori dell’Arma il giovane ha ammesso di aver ferito il rivale in amore e di aver poi gettato il coltello in un cassonetto dove  stato effettivamente ritrovato e sequestrato.   29 luglio 2021, 15:18 - Aggiornata il 29 luglio 2021, 15:19 © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA  "

Nun sind die Kapazitäten vorhanden, aber viele Bürger verweigern die Untersuchung. Hinter dem Boykott stecken die Angst vor dem finanziellen Ruin und ein künstlich erschaffenes Schreckgespenst.",welt.de,"  Die Warnung ist in Großbuchstaben geschrieben: „Testet eure Kinder nicht auf Corona.“ So beginnt eine WhatsApp-Nachricht, die gerade unter Eltern in dem New Yorker Stadtteil Brooklyn zirkuliert. Schüler, die husten und schniefen, bleiben natürlich besser zu Hause, wie es heißt. Aber als Grund für die Abwesenheit sollten lieber „Magenprobleme“ genannt werden – „oder andere Symptome, die nichts mit Covid zu tun haben.“ Warum wollen die Eltern die Corona-Tests verhindern? Sie fürchten, so verrät ihre Textnachricht, dass die New Yorker Behörden bei einem positiven Ergebnis die betroffene Schule schließen. Denn die Regeln der Stadt besagen: Wird das Virus bei zwei Kindern nachgewiesen, müssen alle anderen ebenfalls zu Hause bleiben. Arbeitslosenhilfe hilft nicht wirklich  Die Väter und Mütter aus Brooklyn sind längst nicht die Einzigen, die sich gegen Corona-Tests wehren. Überall in den USA hört man von Verweigerern. Manchmal spielt Politik eine Rolle – Tests gelten einigen Amerikanern wie Masken als Symbol der Unterwerfung. Der Staat, sagen sie, greife damit in ihr Privatleben ein. Vor allem Anhänger des amtierenden Präsidenten Donald Trump sehen es so. Aber die meisten US-Bürger treibt eine andere Sorge um: dass ein positives Ergebnis in den finanziellen Ruin führt. Tatsächlich gibt es im ganzen Land Berichte über Angestellte, die für zwei Wochen in Quarantäne mussten – und gefeuert wurden. Und die staatlichen Hilfen für Arbeitslose sind in vielen Bundesstaaten gering. Mississippi zum Beispiel zahlt höchstens 235 Dollar pro Woche, ohne Krankenversicherung.  Und selbst wer während der Quarantäne seinen Job behält, muss oft auf den Lohn verzichten. Die Corona-Gesetze des US-Kongresses verpflichten nur kleine und mittlere Firmen, ihre isolierten Mitarbeiter weiterhin zu bezahlen. Einige große Unternehmen haben sich freiwillig dazu bereit erklärt.  Aber Gewerkschaften beklagen: Viele andere, darunter vor allem die Fast-Food- und Hotelketten des Landes, überweisen positiv getesteten Angestellten keinen Cent. „Die Angst vor Quarantäne“, meint Marcus Plescia von dem US-amerikanischen Gesundheitsverband ASTHO, „macht viele Angestellte zu Testverweigerern.“ Plescia ist überzeugt, dass eine große Zahl von ihnen das Risiko eines positiven Ergebnisses zu hoch findet. „Sie können es sich nicht leisten“, sagt der Mediziner, „zu Hause zu bleiben.“ In den USA fehlten die Anreize, sich auf Corona testen zu lassen. Es scheint paradox. In den ersten Monaten der Pandemie waren kaum Tests verfügbar, Arztpraxen und Krankenhäuser wiesen viele Menschen mit Symptomen ab. Nun haben Amerikas Labore die nötigen Kapazitäten – aber es fehlen die Kunden.    Dutzende Untersuchungsstellen, heißt es zum Beispiel von der New Yorker Gesundheitsbehörde, seien nicht ausgelastet. Der Organisation Covid Tracking Project zufolge stieg zuletzt in sechs Bundesstaaten die Zahl der Infektionen, während die Zahl der Tests sank. Besonders groß ist die Kluft in Kentucky. Dort nahmen die Corona-Fälle im Oktober um 35 Prozent zu, gleichzeitig gab es 38 Prozent weniger Tests. An Amerikas Hochschulen wächst die Skepsis ebenfalls. Die University of Tennessee zum Beispiel teilte mit, dass sich in der ersten Novemberwoche nur die Hälfte der Studenten den – eigentlich verpflichtenden – Corona-Tests unterzog. In der Vergangenheit seien es immerhin rund zwei Drittel gewesen. Als Grund nennen die Verantwortlichen auch hier die Angst vor Quarantäne. Angst vor dem Big-Brother-Staat Das ist eine dramatische Entwicklung, schließlich gelten Tests zusammen mit Kontaktverfolgung als entscheidend, um Corona unter Kontrolle zu bringen. Nur wenn Infizierte gefunden und isoliert werden, lässt sich die Ausbreitung des Virus verlangsamen. Der Aufstand der Amerikaner gegen Masken und Tests dürfte also zu den hohen Zahlen beitragen. Bei mehr als zehn Millionen US-Bürgern wurde der Erreger bisher nachgewiesen, rund 240.000 sind gestorben. Die Testverweigerer scheint das nicht abzuschrecken. Viele fühlen sich offenbar von der Politik bestätigt. Trump verharmloste das Virus und verspottete Maskenträger, sogar noch nach seiner eigenen Infektion. Das Virus, sagte er immer wieder, werde „irgendwann auf wundersame Weise“ verschwinden. Andere Republikaner verbreiten das Märchen vom kontrollwütigen Staat. Er fürchte, ein positiver Test bringe ihn „auf das Radar“, meinte kürzlich der Abgeordnete Mark Strong aus Utah. „Das Gesundheitsministerium braucht nicht zu wissen, ob ich krank bin.“  Solche Aussagen dürften die Bürger nicht gerade zu Tests ermuntern. Zudem bleibt die wirtschaftliche Lage angespannt – wer will da schon durch Quarantäne seine Stelle aufs Spiel setzen? Amerika steckte bis vor Kurzem in der schlimmsten ökonomischen Krise seit fast 100 Jahren. Als das Land im Frühling in den Lockdown ging, verloren 40 Millionen Bürger ihre Jobs. Die Arbeitslosenquote stieg auf 20 Prozent, ein Wert, der zuletzt in der Großen Depression erreicht worden war. Inzwischen erholt sich die Wirtschaft wieder, von Juli bis September betrug das Wachstum im Quartalsvergleich 7,4 Prozent. Die Arbeitslosenquote sank auf acht Prozent. In vielen Bundesstaaten sind Restaurants und Geschäfte wieder offen, das macht sich bemerkbar. Aber die von Trump angekündigte Entwicklung in Form eines V – rasant abwärts und ebenso rasant wieder aufwärts – ist nicht zu erkennen. Amerikas Wirtschaftsleistung liegt noch 3,5 Prozent niedriger als vor der Pandemie. Das dürfte kein Anreiz sein, sich auf Corona testen zu lassen und die Isolation zu riskieren.   "

Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has repeatedly been dragged into rows over the UK school curriculum, saying pupils should not be taught a one-sided view of history. Schools must teach ‘social justice’ and embed black history across the whole curriculum, said the National Education UnionThe union believes black perspectives should be embedded in every subject – not just history – as part of its drive to ‘decolonise’ the curriculum.A motion on Child Q said the union extended its ‘full solidarity’ to her and added: ‘This humiliating and degrading sexist and racist treatment must not be repeated.The education system as a whole must be decolonised before it can truly be anti-racist.’Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary, said: ‘The curriculum must look to the future, but to do this it must speak accurately about the past in relation to black British history and about Britain’s colonial past.’It comes after schools were accused of indoctrinating children with Left-wing ideology by pushing a ‘woke’ agenda.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi intervened in February, issuing guidance saying pupils should not be taught a one-sided view of history and current affairs.However, delegates vowed to fight it in a series of motions passed at yesterday’s conference in Bournemouth.One motion accused the Government of ‘censoring educators’ and ‘suppressing critical debate about topics such as imperialism and empire.’It committed the NEU to ‘issue union guidance on teaching issues of social justice in schools, which supports members.’  The National Education Union has called on the government to take action after it emerged a black schoolgirl who was wrongly strip-searched. The NEU advocates teaching social justice in schools to prevent similar episodesThe union will also lobby exam boards to show diversity in course content and test papers.Earlier this year, education watchdog Ofsted failed a private school, the American School in London, in an inspection after it imposed a ‘woke’ agenda which breached political impartiality rules.Welbeck Primary in Nottingham has boasted about encouraging ten-year-olds to write letters criticising Boris Johnson.And Brighton and Hove Council wanted teachers to tell children as young as seven they were not ‘racially innocent’ as part of divisive ‘white privilege’ lessons.

Although most of BC’s residents live “down south” within a few hours of the U.S. border, the province extends more than 2,000 kilometres north. With majestic scenery and abundant natural beauty, exploring this picturesque region is perfectly suited for those who enjoy epic road trips — especially when the reward at the end of a long day of driving is a craft brewery serving up delicious beer. From Prince Rupert on the west coast, connected to Vancouver Island by the BC Ferries Inside Passage route, across the province to Valemount near Jasper on the Alberta border, and northeast up to Fort St. John in the Peace Country, 12 craft breweries await discovery on the Northern BC Ale Trail, each one celebrating local history, geography and culture in its own unique way. The western leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail begins in Prince Rupert where the nautically themed Wheelhouse Brewing embraces that community’s connection to the ocean. In nearby Terrace, Sherwood Mountain Brewhouse’s patio is always packed with folks enjoying that inland community’s abundance of sunshine. Smithers, a few hours east, has two craft breweries, Bulkley Valley Brewery and Smithers Brewing, both of which embrace the region’s many outdoor activities: skiing, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing. Then there is Ursa Minor Brewing, which is based on Little Bear Ranch, a 540-acre cattle farm about 100km south of Burns Lake. This side trip involves crossing François Lake by ferry and driving on some dirt roads so be sure to plan ahead and check the brewery’s hours.  Smithers has two craft breweries, Smithers Brewing and Bulkley Valley Brewery, both embracing the region’s many outdoor activities: skiing, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing.  Prince George is the largest city in Northern BC, so it makes sense that all the northern breweries converge there annually for the Kiwanis AleFest. P.G. is also home to Crossroads Brewing & Distillery and Trench Brewing & Distilling, and there’s even a third brewery in the works there. The eastern leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail starts in Fort St. John where you can taste the range of beers available at Beard’s Brewing and Mighty Peace Brewing, both of which love working with local farmers to include local ingredients in their recipes.  The eastern leg of the Northern BC Ale Trail starts in Fort St. John, where you can taste the range of beers available at Mighty Peace Brewing and Beard’s Brewing, both working with farmers to include local ingredients in their recipes.  Then return south to visit Barkerville Brewing on the Gold Rush Trail in Quesnel — the brewery is named for the historic town nearby where you can see what life was like during the Gold Rush. All I know is it’s definitely better with craft beer! Next is Fox Mountain Brewing in Williams Lake, a great spot for both food and beer. Finally, head east to Valemount, home of Three Ranges Brewing, a pioneer operation that helped bring awareness of craft beer to the North and has been slaking the thirst of local residents for several years already.

It’s our loss. She was the most amazing thing to ever walk this planet.”Describing the day of the explosion, Mrs Ahmad said she had been on the phone to her mother, who was going to collect the children, and “within seconds she heard me scream because there was a big bang”.By the time she got to the hallway, “Sahara’s room had collapsed already”.She said her family did everything they could, with her father and brother pulling the other children to safety.An 11-year-old boy and 54-year-old woman hurt in the blast remain in hospital, with neither in a life-threatening condition."

इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।  वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है। उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।  यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई बेहद सख्त प्रावधान किए गए हैं। इस कानून के तहत केस में अग्रिम जमानत नहीं मिल सकती। किसी भी भारतीय या विदेशी के खिलाफ इस कानून के तहत केस चल सकता है। अपराध कहां पर हुआ है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। विदेशी धरती पर अपराध किए जाने के मामले में भी इसके तहत मुकदमा दर्ज हो सकता है। यह कानून एनआईए को अधिकार देता है कि वह किसी तरह की आतंकी गतिविधि में शामिल संदिग्ध को आतंकी घोषित कर सकती है। पहले यह व्यवस्था थी कि आतंकवाद के किसी भी मामले में संपत्ति अटैच करने की कार्यवाही जांच अधिकारी बिना डीजीपी की अनुमति लिए नहीं कर सकता था। अब एनआईए का जांच अफसर सिर्फ एनआईए के डीजी की इजाजत लेकर कार्रवाई कर सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।    विस्तार   देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।      जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।           मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128

Kevin Brady of the Ways and Means Committee.NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!   Americans no longer believe in Joe Biden.      In the latest Economist/YouGov poll, only 40% consider the president honest; 43% consider Biden ""not honest or trustworthy"" and 17% are not sure. That’s down from 48% considering the president honest and only 38% thinking otherwise in February. No wonder he’s struggling to get his agenda passed.  The Biden administration is lying to the American people about so many issues. That includes the border, which White House spokesperson Jen Psaki claims with a straight face is ""not open,"" and disappointing COVID vaccination rates, which Biden blames on Republican governors, even as one of the most hesitant groups turns out to be African Americans. LIZ PEEK: BIDEN, BLINKEN FAILING – WEAK, FECKLESS LEADERSHIP CREATING SERIES OF DISASTERS, HURTING USBut it is about the economy that Joe Biden is most dishonest. As Democrats race to push through their controversial $3.5 trillion spending package, which will saddle the country with expensive new entitlements programs, Americans deserve to know the truth. Let’s start with Biden’s claim that Democrats’ giant ""social infrastructure"" bill will be ""totally paid for"" and not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 per year.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTERReality check: The 40 separate tax hikes recently proposed by the House are expected to net roughly $2 trillion, not even close to covering the $3.5 trillion price tag, which many analysts say significantly understates the proposal’s real cost. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, for instance, suggests the plan would end up costing $5 trillion to $5.5 trillion over a decade.  Additionally, the left-leaning Tax Policy Center found that, ""Including corporate tax increases, most households would pay more in 2022. About three-quarters of middle-income households would face a tax increase averaging about $300.""  Consider, too, Biden’s endless refrain that the wealthy and big corporations ""don’t pay their fair share."" He never provides any proof of this populist talking point, because he cannot. The Tax Foundation reports that, in 2018, the latest year for which such data is available, ""The top 1% paid a greater share of individual income taxes (40.1%) than the bottom 90% combined (28.6%)."" That seems a ""fair share."" On Sept. 16, Biden questioned, ""How is it possible for millionaires and billionaires that can pay a lower rate of tax than teachers, firefighters or law enforcement officers?""  Reality: the top 1% of taxpayers paid a 25.4% average individual income tax rate, more than seven times the rate paid by taxpayers in the bottom 50% (3.4%). A majority in all districts were negative on the $3.5 trillion spending plan. The fact is that the U.S. tax code is the most progressive among the 38 countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The more you earn, the more you pay.   Biden might have more credibility on other peoples’ taxes if he hadn’t apparently underpaid his own, to the tune of $500,000. He evidently used an ""S"" corporation to lower his tax rate but did not pay Medicare taxes, as he should have, just the kind of gimmick that he claims allows ""trillionaires and billionaires"" to pay less than they owe. By the way, there are no ""trillionaires."" More fundamentally, Biden is also lying when he insists that his big spending plans are necessary to ""build back"" the economy, and that the giant infusion of cash won’t spur inflation. Neither is true.  The economy is humming. As he boasted recently, even as he called for mammoth new spending, ""Our economy is growing at the fastest rate we’ve seen in nearly 40 years.""  Though Biden takes credit for the rebound, it was well under way when he took office. Growth in the first quarter, as he entered the White House, was 6.4%.   Biden is also dishonest about inflation. The White House has insisted for months that rising inflation is ""transitory,"" and that spending trillions more on ""social infrastructure"" would actually help cool rising prices. Neither assertion is true.  The White House has more than doubled its estimate of inflation for this year, now projecting a year-over-year price hike of 4.8% in the fourth quarter compared to an earlier forecast of 2%.   ""We think this trajectory is very much consistent with the inflation outlook we’ve been discussing pretty much since we got here,"" said one White House official. Not true; the 2% forecast is from just three months earlier. Inflation is likely to get worse and last longer than officials are admitting. A slew of companies, including Costco, Nike, FedEx and General Mills, have just recently warned that they are raising prices to cover increasing expenses, and that costly supply disruptions are likely to persist. Inflation has been spurred by supply hiccups, but also by strong consumer demand. Simply put, there’s too much money chasing too few goods. Americans have enjoyed an historic rise in net worth, as home and stock prices hit all-time highs, thanks in part to the extreme monetary largesse of the Federal Reserve. That wealth increase boosts consumer spending, which is also benefiting from more than $5 trillion in COVID relief aid authorized over the past 18 months.   Biden and his Democrat colleagues claim the enormous handouts to Big Labor and to other Democrat support groups in their ""social infrastructure"" bill will not spur inflation but actually restrain it by easing supply bottlenecks.  Voters are not buying it. Polling by the right-leaning Remington Research Group in select toss-up districts shows that a majority of voters in all but one area agreed that ""The recent massive increase in government spending is the primary cause of inflation, driving up the cost of living.""  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPA majority in all districts were negative on the $3.5 trillion spending plan, with a plurality of voters concurring that the huge spending package would make inflation worse; a majority disagreed with raising taxes to pay for it. Americans are anxious about rising prices, and they know Biden’s exorbitant spending plans will likely make the problem worse. The president tells them otherwise, but voters have wised up. They no longer believe him.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK  "

We will work hard to redeploy as many employees as possible to other opportunities throughout the company.”  But sawmill closures and curtailments were happening in B.C. before the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the second half of 2019, 3,000 sawmill workers lost their jobs to sawmill closures and curtailments in B.C., due to a shrinkage in the annual allowable cut, high stumpage prices and falling demand and prices for lumber in the U.S.  In addition to permanently shutting down the Isle Pierre mill, Canfor's pulp division, Canfor Pulp Products Inc. (TSX:CFX), plans to  curtail production at its Prince George Pulp and Paper and Intercontinental Pulp mills for four weeks starting July 6.  nbennett@biv.com  @nbennett_biv                    "

The self-styled daredevil died Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020,  BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) — A California man who said he wanted to fly to the edge of outer space to see if the world is round has died after his home-built rocket blasted off into the desert sky and plunged back to earth.  “Mad"" Mike Hughes was killed on Saturday afternoon after his rocket crashed on private property near Barstow, California.  Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.  The Science Channel said on Twitter it had been chronicling Hughes' journey and that “thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time.”  “It was always his dream to do this launch,” the Twitter message said.  A video on TMZ.com showed the rocket taking off, with what appears to be a parachute tearing off during the launch. The steam-powered rocket streaks upward, then takes around 10 seconds to fall straight back to earth. Shrieks can be heard as the rocket plows into the desert.  Freelance journalist Justin Chapman, who was at the scene, said the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have caused the mishap with the parachute.  In March 2018, Hughes propelled himself about 1,875 feet (570 meters) into the air before a hard landing in the Mojave Desert in California. He said in a video that his goal was to eventually fly to the edge of outer space to determine for himself whether the world is round.  “I don't want to take anyone else's word for it,” he said in the video, posted on the BBC News website. “I don't know if the world is flat or round.”  In another video, Hughes said he also wanted “to convince people they can do things that are extraordinary with their lives.”  “My story really is incredible,” Hughes once told The Associated Press. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.”  "

Now, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction  Israel's border fence with Syria, March 2019.  Gil Eliahu  Recent events on the Syrian border express what Military Intelligence has described over the past two months as the establishment of a new deterrent. Iran has decided to act against any attack it attributes to Israel, whether against Iran or organizations linked to it in the Middle East. At around 5 A.M., members of a Shi’ite militia fired four rockets from Syria into Israel in the northern Golan Heights; an Iron Dome battery intercepted all four and there were no injuries or damage.  skip - Haaretz Weekly Ep. 49  The rocket fire in September  was declared an Iranian response to an airstrike attributed to Israel against members of a Shi’ite militia in  near the Al-Bukamal border crossing with Syria. The airstrike happened at the end of August, after a day when airstrikes took place in Syria as well (near the Israeli border) and in Lebanon (in Dahiyeh, the Shi’ite neighborhood in south Beirut).  But in recent years, many attacks have been attributed to Israel and the Iranians responded in only a few cases. This time, according to intelligence, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction. So what was the explanation for the rockets before dawn Tuesday?  As of now, things aren’t completely clear; both Israel and Iran have remained silent. On Monday, the Israeli intelligence company ImageSat released satellite photos documenting what it calls the rapid construction of an Iranian base near the Al-Bukamal crossing.  There are also reports in the Arab media, of questionable credibility, of an incident at the beginning of the week in which a convoy of Shi’ite militias was struck in the desert in eastern Syria west of Deir Ezzor.  A photo released by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq after it launched an attack near the Syrian border, August 2019.  These incidents are happening against the backdrop of heightened preparedness by the Israeli military (which regularly moves Iron Dome batteries between southern and northern Israel), ongoing tension in  the Gaza Strip  (after the fighting with Islamic Jihad last week), intensive action by the Israel Air Force and a surprise drill declared Monday by the Northern Command. At the same time, Israel is in a political crisis as the time allotted to  Kahol Lavan chief Benny Gantz  to form a governing coalition draws to a close. This is a period when the dangers of mixing security and political considerations is higher than usual.  But apparently the most important regional development in recent days – and the competition is great – isn’t happening in Israel or Syria, but in Iran. Despite the regime’s harsh steps, above all cutting the country off from the Internet almost completely, the impression is that  the protests against the government  Reports by opposition activists and journalists coming indirectly to international media outlets reveal a major wave of violent demonstrations, organized attempts to use violence to suppress them, the deaths of dozens of protesters and a few members of the security forces, and methodical large-scale destruction of property. The real number of the injured or killed, like the exact scope of the demonstrations, is unclear.  Iranian-American journalist Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for The New York Times, tweeted on Monday night: “I’ve covered Iran for 25+ years. Never seen protests this brazen, this angry, this widespread. This is serious. That’s why there is a total Internet blackout. Regime is scared.” The protests in Iran broke out against the backdrop of the crises  in Iraq  and  Lebanon  , countries under strong Iranian influence.  In recent days, Arab newspapers have been covering their front pages with protests, incidents and mass-casualty disasters from Iran, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan. To some extent, these seem like a reincarnation of the Arab Spring, which was buried by the murderous civil wars that broke out in its wake. But this time, the main address for the protest in some of the countries is Iran, whose influence and power have grown, especially after the Assad regime's victory in Syria.  A gas station that was burned during protests following authorities' decision to raise gasoline prices, Tehran, November 17, 2019.  Abdolvahed Mirzazadeh / ISNA via AP  Ostensibly, recent developments in Iran should encourage Israel after a few months of the Iranians showing confidence and upping their provocations against the Gulf states and the United States. But officially, Jerusalem has been restrained in its public response. Perhaps more surprisingly, that has also been President Donald Trump’s response; in recent days he has been in no hurry to comment on Iran.  This is surprising because Trump has been harshly criticized, justifiably, for his inaction in the face of Iranian military operations. Now, when it seems that his sanctions policy is finally sparking a response in Iran, Trump is mired in political disputes at home.  Israeli defense officials have adamantly refused to predict what can be expected in Iran and are waiting for more information. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies,  has written on the think tank’s website  that right now there are no signs that the Iranian regime is in danger of collapse or is considering flexibility or giving in to Western demands regarding the nuclear agreement, despite the double pressure of protests and sanctions.  Zimmt is very cautious in his predictions; the regime in Tehran has been very effective in suppressing protests. But one lesson of the Arab Spring is the great difficulty in predicting the masses’ behavior during violent clashes and anticipating how protests will unfold.  Israel, by the way, didn’t have to wait for the Arab Spring to reach this conclusion. It learned this quite well during the first intifada, and to a lesser extent at the beginning of the second intifada.  "

Her Majesty has battled health problems for months.  It is feared the monarch, who is not as mobile as she was, may avoid being in public on the balcony. The Queen now uses a wheelchair and walking stick in private. A musical finale will take place around the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace, with a rendition of the national anthem and the nearby public invited to become part of the performance. Ed Sheeran will lead a special tribute to the Queen, with the royals most likely looking on from the balcony and the pop star joined by other stars and artists. READ MOREITV Loose Women star Brenda Edwards shares video of cat talking to her  An insider told the Daily Mail : “It could still happen but it is by no means guaranteed that we will see the Queen on the balcony during the Jubilee.”  Rosanna Machado, chief executive of the pageant, said: ""We are liaising with the royal household about involvement of all members of the royal family and details will be released in due course.""

Under the order's conditions, renters must sign a declaration that they make less than $99,000 a year, or twice that amount if filing a joint tax return.The order ""does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract,"" according to the CDC's order.Landlords can continue to collect ""fees, penalties or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract,"" according to the order.The order expires on 31 December.As many as 40m people in the US could be at risk of eviction, according to the Aspen Institute, while nearly half of all renters in the US are cost-burdened, or paying more than 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.Protests across the US led by renters, tenant organisations and housing groups have demanded local and federal governments ""cancel rent"" and extend eviction moratoriums.""A uniform, national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent is long overdue and badly needed,"" the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement. ""The very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won't lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration's action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.""The organisation said that while the""eviction moratorium is an essential step,"" it is merely a ""half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,"" according to the organisation.""This action delays but does not prevent evictions,"" the statement said.The order follows a series of executive orders from Donald Trump, sidestepping Congress after it failed to extend federal unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, as locally issued moratoriums on eviction proceedings were lifted and courts reopened their dockets.But the president's order did not immediately halt evictions, despite his emphatic claims last month that renters are ""not going to be evicted"" because of his order.""We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen,"" he said last month. ""We're not going to evict people ... We are not letting people be evicted.""His order, signed on 8 August, directed federal agencies to ""consider"" whether halting evictions are necessary as a health precaution during the pandemic.House Democrats passed two measures with up to $100 billion for rental assistance, but the Republican-dominated Senate has not agreed to take up the legislation.The National Low Income Housing Coalition has urged the president to work with Congress to put in place a national moratorium on all evictions with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and housing vouchers, and another $11.5 billion for emergency resources for people experiencing homelessness.""Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression,"" the organisation's president Diane Yentel said. ""Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless."""

Your first line of defence is to say there must have been a mistake because you have never owned a car in your life. Documents are quickly produced to prove that you do in fact, own a car.  No matter. Your next move is to say, “OK, I do own a car. Fine. But there’s no way I was the one driving it.”  Photographic evidence is then produced showing you at the wheel of the car at the time of the offence, laughing your head off as you hit 100mph in a 30 zone. “Damn,” you say. “OK. It was me, but here’s the thing. I didn’t realise it was a 30 zone. I thought it was OK to do 100.”  Inevitably, evidence is then produced that shows not only did you know it was a 30 zone, you personally signed the papers declaring it a 30 zone and went on TV to talk at length about how good and important this zone was and how we must all obey the limit. You have now been caught in three, proven, open lies. What happens to you?   If you’re Boris Johnson, absolutely nothing. We went from “I didn’t attend any parties”, to “I attended a few but no rules were broken”, to “OK, rules were broken but I didn’t understand the rules so it’s fine”. With no consequences.

While all of this was going on, next door at No11 Downing Street, it transpired that our Chancellor was in charge of the UK’s money while legally domiciled in another country for tax-avoidance purposes while his wife didn’t pay UK tax at all because she was legally domiciled in yet another country. The good news is the disgrace of this was so huge that Rishi Sunak had to resign. Oh, wait. No. He was fine. Nothing happened. Across the water in America, it turns out that Team Trump actually put their plan to overturn the 2020 election in writing. Two days after the election, while votes were still being counted, then president Trump’s half-witted idiot son Don Jnr (the child, you’ll remember, that Trump hesitated to have named after him in case he turned out to be “a loser”, one of the few instances of Trump’s foresight actually being bang on the money) sent texts to Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows that were basically captioned, “WAYS WE CAN FRAUDULENTLY OVERTURN THE ELECTION AND JUST STAY IN POWER”.  Mind you, I could have saved the January 6 commission the trouble of digging into Don Jnr’s texts. You only had to watch the deranged news conference Donald Snr gave at 2am on election night – the one where he said, “We were getting ready to win this election, frankly WE DID WIN IT!” before asking for all vote counting to be stopped and have himself declared the winner – to get the idea that, “Hey, maybe these guys aren’t going to play by the rules’. But now all the evidence is out in the open the good news is that the Trumps are all going to be prosecuted for conspiring to defraud the American people. Ah, no, hang on. Nothing of the sort happened. They’re totally free to go about their business while Fox News – the real Fox News, not the British version – devotes zero mention to the scandal while banging on 200 times a day about Hunter Biden’s laptop. What happens to a country when it becomes so corrupt that the rules only apply to the little people? When the wealthy and powerful are free to choose which laws apply to them? When they have state propaganda channels that will happily broadcast any version of the truth they want?   You’re seeing it now in real time. You end up with a lawless, brutal state that is an international pariah. Led by a guy in a bunker somewhere deep beneath Moscow directing an illegal, genocidal invasion. How the American dream turned sour unless you're filthy rich... And while the privileged rewrite the rules to suit themselves and slide through life untouched, what’s happening to those less fortunate? Demand for food banks has been steadily rising over the pandemic, but recently, it’s been growing exponentially. Managers at food banks in major UK cities are now openly saying they are “terrified” by what they’re seeing. The good news is that energy prices are set to get much lower, so… Oh no. Wait. That is not what’s happening at all. Energy prices are about to go through the roof.

224206060,2021-08-26 19:24:16.685177+00:00,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/957213?src=rss,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/957213?src=rss,"As In-Person Conferences Resume, Docs Rethink Travel Frequency","Hybrid conferences with virtual and on-site options are the way of the post-pandemic future say many, including AHA and ACC scientific session organizers.",medscape.com,"       Now that some travel restrictions have eased and vaccinations are readily available in the US, a few in-person conferences have taken place. But the ""pandemic pause"" has led some doctors to rethink their pre-COVID conference travel frequency.       ""On average, [pre-pandemic], I would travel 25 to 30 weekends a year"" to conferences and symposia,"" Jagmeet P. Singh, MD, PhD, DPhil, told theheart.org | Medscape Cardiology, adding that ""I don't see myself going back to doing that again. I will choose my travel more selectively.""                   Singh, from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, gave an example: ""As much as I would like to travel to Tokyo to give a lecture, I think traveling 4 days to give a 20-minute talk…is not cost-efficient and does not make sense.""       Martha Gulati, MD, president-elect of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology, said ""I really love traveling,"" but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report issued this month detailing faster-than-expected global warming and the need to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions ""has made me rethink what should be essential travel.""                    Merits and Drawbacks of a Virtual Conference        With more than 100 countries in some form of pandemic lockdown in March 2020, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) was one of the first medical conferences to pivot to a virtual format.                   Gulati confided that she enjoyed the virtual meetings more than she had anticipated.         Notably, the European Society of Cardiology meeting in August 2020, for which conference organizers had a bit more time to prepare, was ""outstanding,"" she said, ""one of the best that I have experienced.""                                       The ESC 2020 virtual studio.        Singh noted that a key benefit of a virtual meeting is that people around the world who might not have been able to attend in person — because of cost or inability to take time away from work or family — are able to access the science as it is being presented.                   However, on a Zoom platform, ""there's always the potential for getting distracted, [unlike] a live session where you're compelled to give your 100% attention,"" he acknowledged.                   Suzanne Feigofsky, MD, a cardiologist at the Iowa Heart Center in Carroll, agreed. ""Before, you blocked your time and went. Now you are probably watching the meeting in your spare time"" and multi-tasking.             However, as a parent to a 5-year-old and an 11-year-old, virtual meetings have been incredibly beneficial, Feigofsky added. In a recent viewpoint article in JACC, she described how female cardiologists who have young children face challenges if they wish to travel to and present at scientific sessions.             ""Having the flexibility to learn on your own time has really been something wonderful that's come out of the pandemic,"" she said.             Michelle L. O'Donoghue, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, concurred. ""The virtual platform has made the at-home experience very appealing,"" she said. ""This is perhaps especially true for women with young families.""             O'Donoghue was hesitant to attend an in-person American College of Cardiology meeting in March of this year because it would have meant leaving her new baby, but she was able to chair sessions virtually.              Are Hybrid Scientific Sessions the Way of the Future?        The biggest downside to virtual meetings is the limited interaction with speakers and other attendees.             ""I love going to the meeting as much for the science as for the people,"" Feigofsky said.             ""The benefit of the in-person meeting is what happens outside the sessions,"" she elaborated. ""Collaborations that happen, and just meeting people that you have admired and not worked with personally is invaluable.""             Gulati and Singh wholeheartedly agreed with that sentiment.               ""The casual between-panelist banter that most attendees enjoy is missing,"" said Singh, who attended the Heart Rhythm Society meeting in July in Boston. ""It was amazing to actually have an in-person meeting after so long — collaborating and meeting all your colleagues. The level of engagement was phenomenal.""             He gave a lecture to about 100 attendees while another 300 people followed online ""and everyone could benefit from live, unstructured banter,"" he said.                                 Attendees at Heart Rhythm Society 2021.        More than 4000 people attended HRS in person and another 1500 or so tuned in virtually.               ""As technology continues to evolve, it's clear that a successful virtual meeting can be readily achieved, as was seen during the thick of the pandemic,"" noted O'Donoghue. But ""ultimately, a hybrid approach to conference attendance may make the most sense.""              ""I hope that hybrid meetings will stick around,"" Feigofsky said. ""It allows us to include speakers and talented physicians that may not otherwise engage in those meetings and you can participate in a late-breaking trial and watch it virtually without having to go to the meeting. I think that is something that should stay.""              What Are AHA and ACC Meeting Organizers Planning?        It appears that the organizers of the major US cardiology conferences agree.             The American Heart Association (AHA) decided to offer a hybrid format for the 2021 Scientific Sessions in Boston in November because of anticipated potential travel difficulties, said Manesh R. Patel, MD, chair of AHA's Committee on Scientific Sessions Program.             The 3-day hybrid event will include more than 500 sessions. The organizers are monitoring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations, given the presence of the highly infectious Delta variant of COVID-19, and will share any updates as soon as possible with participants.             ""We envision that we will have both in-person and virtual options for years to come,"" said Patel, chief of the Division of Cardiology at Duke School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.             Similarly, Janice Sibley, ACC executive vice president for education and publications, said: ""ACC will deliver hybrid events for the foreseeable future, [since] hybrid conferences offer the best opportunity for all interested parties — presenters, moderators, attendees — to participate in the way that best works for them.""               Attendees at ACC.21 Virtual, who came from more than 120 countries, ""gave us very positive feedback,"" she noted.             ""All organizations are experimenting with new 'fee versus free' models for conference attendance,"" Sibley added, and will likely continue to do so over the next couple of years.""              Registration fees for AHA members for the 2021 Scientific Sessions, for example, are $199 and $299 for the virtual meeting and $495 and $595 for the onsite meeting, for early bird and standard registration, respectively.             The registration fees for ACC.22 will be available mid October.             ""See you online or in-person [in Washington] at ACC.22, April 2-4, 2022!"" Sibley said.              Key Takeaways:                Virtual conferences allow those who could not afford to travel or take time away from work or family to attend        Only a live meeting gives people the opportunity to meet and collaborate in person with mentors and colleagues, which most consider just as important as the science        Some physicians plan to rethink very frequent travel to conferences and symposia for both lifestyle and environmental reasons        The ACC and AHA plan to provide a hybrid on-site plus virtual annual conference ""for the foreseeable future""                     Marlene Busko is an independent medical journalist who specializes in reporting about diabetes and endocrinology, cardiology, and nephrology.

Sure. Plus a trade deal, an FBI feud, a campaign rally and more: Analysis",House Democrats unveil two Articles of Impeachment against the president on a day that demonstrates the collision of news in the Era of Trump.,usatoday.com,"Washington whiplash.  That’s when House Democrats gravely  unveil Articles of Impeachment  against President Trump at 9 a.m., then an hour later celebrate a deal delivering one of his top priorities, a  new North American free trade pact  . Followed in short order by Trump meeting at the White House with the foreign minister of Russia, a reminder of the allegations of election interference that shadowed the last presidential campaign.  And, now, that shadows the next one.  “This solemn day,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared as she opened the impeachment announcement, standing in front of four American flags and a portrait of George Washington. Within the hour, Trump had responded, in a way, with a two-word tweet: “WITCH HUNT!” Though in another tweet, he praised ""very good Democrat support"" for the U.S-Mexica-Canada trade pact called USMCA.  The head-spinning day reflected the accelerating news cycle that has marked the Era of Trump, a constant collision of developments, some of them jaw-dropping. In the old days (that is, before his inauguration in 2017) a  president's denunciation of the FBI director  he had appointed to the job would have been, well, big news. That also happened Tuesday, after FBI Director Christopher Wray had told ABC News that the Justice Department's inspector general hadn't found any political bias behind the Russia probe, as Trump has long alleged.  In an angry tweet, the president referred to Wray as the ""current Director of the FBI,"" the use of the word ""current"" not exactly a signal of job security. ""With that kind of attitude, he will never be able to fix the FBI,"" he declared.  But that contretemps was decidedly secondary to Tuesday's main headline: Impeachment.  Trump: at the edge of impeachment  Trump is just the fourth president in American history to find himself standing at the edge of impeachment, the most drastic check-and-balance in the Constitution between co-equal branches of government. That is a distinction he would have preferred not to hold, even though the Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to convict him in the trial that is expected to follow in January.  The two articles of impeachment  released Tuesday by the House Judiciary Committee charge Trump with abuse of power for using military aid and the promise of an Oval Office meeting to pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation that could have boosted his re-election prospects. He is also accused of obstruction of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas for documents and the testimony of officials in the probe.  The announcement that House Democrats had agreed to back the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, called USMCA, was also significant news, though. In the space of one hour's time and a five-minute walk inside the Capitol from the wood-paneled Rayburn Room to the modern radio-TV correspondents studio, it offered a jarring change of pace and tone.  Surrounded by more than two dozen key Democrats, Pelosi cheerfully called the trade deal ""much better than NAFTA"" and, in a needle to Trump, ""infinitely better than what was originally proposed by the administration."" She joked with House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., about watching football Sunday as the final negotiations were unfolding and led a round of applause for their work.  The juxtaposition of news was no accident.  With that timing, Pelosi was making the point that Democrats could move on impeachment while also scoring progress on legislation – demonstrating the political version of the ability to walk and chew gum at the same time. She was also trying to demonstrate that they could charge Trump with the most serious abuses of office while also working with him on big issues, a counter to the Republican assertion that Democrats are driven by animus against the president.   History mixed on impeachment fallout  That could be an important point to make politically for House members, whose seats are all up for election next year – and especially for the 31 Democrats who represent congressional districts that Trump carried in 2016. They were among the most nervous about proceeding with impeachment.   Neither side is entirely certain what the political repercussions of impeachment will be. Or even how big a role impeachment will play by Election Day next November. History's record is mixed. The move to impeach Republican Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be removed from office, contributed to catastrophic losses for his party in Congress in the next election, in 1974. But the move to impeach Democrat Bill Clinton rebounded against his accusers in the 1998 election.  "

(JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images)  Activists took to the streets Saturday to hold rallies calling for the impeachment of President Trump, as they seek to pile further pressure on Democratic leaders in Congress to  back a push to oust the president  “Donald Trump&apos;s abuses of our communities and country demand action from Congress, which has the responsibility and authority to hold Trump accountable,” a website page for the  ""#ImpeachTrump: Act to Defend Democracy"" national day of action by left-wing group   MoveOn  read. “The next crucial step is an inquiry into whether to draft articles of impeachment.”  The call included a note that the actions “are intended to be nonviolent and peaceful” and that organizers expect protesters to “act lawfully” and de-escalate any confrontation.  The outlet reported that the day began with a protest in Seal Beach -- aptly named “Impeach on the Beach” where demonstrators spelled out “Impeach!” with beach towels.  “An impeachment inquiry is the best way for Congress to continue to investigate Trump&apos;s crimes, misconduct and abuse of power,” the event details read.  reported that some events will be protests, while others will be readings of pro-impeachment speeches from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Minn.  The rallies come amid continued calls for Trump’s impeachment by the left-wing base of the Democratic Party in the wake of the release of the partially-redacted Russia report.  While that report did not find sufficient evidence to charge members of the Trump team with conspiracy, and declined to make a call on if Trump obstructed justice, Democrats have claimed that the report raises further questions about both topics and have sought to continue investigations in the House.  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., on Wednesday  held the second in a series of hearings on the Russia controversy  , to examine what he called “the disturbing findings” of the report. Republicans slammed what they called a ""grotesque spectacle.""  However, Democratic leaders have expressed nervousness about a push for impeachment. Such a push may succeed in the House, but would almost certainly fail in the Republican-controlled Senate.  This week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said that impeachment was “not even close in our caucus.”  “It&apos;s not off the table,” the speaker said, before adding, “I don&apos;t think you should impeach for political reasons and I don&apos;t think you should not impeach for political reasons.”  "

Ezzel-Deen al-Falih, a spokesman for the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR), said Prime Minister Abdallah al-Thani tendered the government's resignation to Speaker Aguila Saleh late on Sunday.  Parliamentary spokesman Abdallah Abaihig said HoR lawmakers would review the resignation of al-Thani's government, which is not internationally recognised, in their next meeting. No date has been set for the session.  Oil-rich Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gaddafi, who was later killed. The country has since split between rival east- and west-based administrations, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.  A 14-month offensive by Haftar's forces to wrest control of the capital, Tripoli, from the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) crumbled in June, with the front lines now solidified near the central city of Sirte.    The HoR on Friday accused the Central Bank and the GNA of ""plundering"" the country and neglecting the east, in apparent efforts to deflect blame for the deterioration of public services.  In recent days, hundreds of people have taken to the streets of Benghazi and other eastern cities to protest against crippling electricity shortages and poor living conditions, setting tyres ablaze and blocking traffic on several major roads.  On Saturday, protests also erupted in al-Marj, a Haftar stronghold.  In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said at least one civilian had reportedly been killed and three others wounded in al-Marj. It called for ""a thorough and immediate"" investigation into ""the reported excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrations"" and the speedy release of a number of detained protesters.       The demonstrations in eastern Libya mirror similar protests in recent weeks over power cuts and corruption in Tripoli and other western cities.  UNSMIL said the protests across Libya were ""motivated by deep-seated frustrations about sustained poor living conditions, shortages of electricity and water, rampant corruption, misgovernance, and a lack of service provision throughout the country"".  The UN mission said the protests underscore ""the urgent need to lift the oil blockade"" and the return to a ""full and inclusive"" political process to end Libya's years-long conflict.  Powerful tribes in eastern Libya loyal to Haftar closed oil export terminals and choked off major pipelines at the start of the year to pressure the GNA.  The US Embassy in Libya said Haftar agreed to reopen oil fields and terminals no later than Saturday. By Sunday evening, it was not clear whether the blockade had been lifted.                            SOURCE:              Al Jazeera and news agencies            "

Article content – Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region, first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in late 2014 and quickly established a reputation for extreme brutality.  – Some experts on Islamist militancy in the region say it was founded by hardline elements of the Pakistani Taliban who fled into Afghanistan when Pakistan security forces cracked down on them. – From the beginning, the hardline Sunni Muslim group generally known as Daesh challenged the Taliban for control of key areas on the border with Pakistan associated with smuggling of narcotics and other commodities. – At the same time, it also carried out a series of suicide bombings in Kabul and other cities against both government and foreign military targets, apparently aimed at establishing its credentials as a more violent and extreme militant movement.    Advertisement       This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.         Article content – Its attacks ranged from the brutal executions of village elders to the killings of Red Cross workers and suicide attacks on crowds, including a series of bloody suicide operations against targets associated with the Shi’ite minority.     We apologize, but this video has failed to load.    VIDEO  – Initially confined to a small number of areas on the border with Pakistan, the group established a second major front in northern provinces including Jawzjan and Faryab. The Combating Terrorism Center at West Point said ISIS-K includes Pakistanis from other militant groups and Uzbek extremists in addition to Afghans. – In April 2017, a U.S. cargo aircraft dropped a 20,000-pound bomb, known as the MOAB (Mother of All Bombs), on a cave complex linked to ISIS-K in Achin district, eastern Afghanistan. It was the largest conventional bomb in the U.S. arsenal.    Advertisement       This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.         Article content – ISIS-K has fought both the Western-backed government and the Taliban, but its precise operational connection with the main Islamic State movement in Iraq and Syria remains uncertain. – U.S. intelligence officials believe the movement used the instability that led to the collapse of the Western-backed government this month to strengthen its position and step up recruitment of disenfranchised Taliban members. – Among its recent targets was a Sufi mosque, electrical pylons and fuel tankers and Shi’ite bus passengers in Kabul. In addition, U.S. officials believe an attack on a girls school for the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority was the work of ISIS-K.      Share this article in your social network                   "

The model has its roots in Columbus, Ohio, where a judge decided to direct women towards rehabilitation instead of jail.  Ten years ago, Judge Paul Herbert was sitting in a Columbus courtroom when he noticed a trend. He was seeing lots of women who were abused and forced into sex work, but they were being treated like criminals.  ""The sheriff brings the next defendant out on the wall chained up,"" Herbert says, ""And it's a woman and she's all beat up, she's looking exactly like one of these victims of domestic violence except she's in handcuffs and a jail suit. I look down at the file and it says prostitute.""  Herbert realized the law didn't recognize these women as victims of human trafficking. So he pitched the idea of a courtroom dedicated to recovery, not punishment. It's called CATCH Court, which stands for Changing Actions to Change Habits.  ""We didn't have the vocabulary that we do, even the vocabulary, let alone the way society looked at these women,"" Herbert says. ""So it was pretty much, we were kind of a laughing stock.""  At the start, CATCH was one of only a few such programs in the country.  There are now seven of these specialized courts in Ohio alone. There are similar programs in Texas, Illinois, Tennessee and Louisiana, and Herbert has helped cities get the courts up and running.  Here's how it works: The program takes care of housing and food – things the women would normally rely on their trafficker for. Participants get treatment for trauma and addiction, and are eligible to get their records expunged.  In exchange, they're subject to drug testing, and must show up in court every week for two years.  While it costs 200 thousand dollars a year to run CATCH Court, Judge Herbert says that's a bargain.  ""If you want to do nothing, you're going to keep spending 5.4 million dollars a year to arrest and jail these women and have no improvement in the circumstance,"" Herbert says.  But this program is intense. Fewer than 1 in 4 of the women enrolled make it to graduation.  ""We had a person who left our house and she was a catch court dropout, I can tell you I've had about maybe 15 this year,"" says Esther Flores. She runs a safe house for women in sex work, and says CATCH is great for those who graduate, but doesn't do enough the women who don't.  Some women drop out because they get jobs and don't need the assistance, but Flores says she has seen others end up back on the street.  ""I became addicted to drugs and then the trafficker found me,"" says Vanessa Perkins. She's one of CATCH's first successful graduates.  Perkins was sexually abused as a young girl, and started drinking and doing drugs when she was only 12.  ""He preyed on my vulnerabilities on purpose, knew what he was doing,"" she says. ""From drug addiction to love, to family, to loyalty. He preyed on all of that stuff I was missing.""  In a twist Perkins says she never could have imagined, years after completing the program, Judge Herbert asked her to be the bailiff in his court — the very court that helped her recover. Now she helps other women who are going through what she did, years ago.  ""They're like, if you can do it, I can do it. Especially if I happened to be out there with them,"" she says. ""Cause there's people that come in that we was on the streets together.""  CATCH has found success keeping women out of the system, regardless of if they cross the graduation stage – the recidivism rate for women in prostitution nationwide is 80 percent. That number drops by half for women enrolled in CATCH for any amount of time, and even further to 20% for the women who make it to graduation.  "

The prospect was part of a memorandum of understanding signed between New Zealand and Singapore at Changi Airport on Wednesday, as part of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s visit to the country. The aviation agreement commits the two nations to collaborating on sustainable aviation policy and infrastructure. Both countries rely heavily on aviation-fuelled tourism, which currently entails high emissions.Henry Cooke/StuffPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern toured Singapore’s giant port on Wednesday as part of her first trip overseas since the Covid pandemic began. It commits the countries to study the prospect of “green lane” flights between Singapore and New Zealand which would use more sustainable fuels.

It also sits counter to our brand as a nation, and also what many tourists are looking for,” Ardern said. It is the first such agreement signed by either of the countries. Ardern travelled to Singapore with the chief executives of Auckland and Christchurch airports, and Air NZ chief executive Greg Foran flew over for the announcement. Ardern herself flew on an older Air Force Boeing that needed refuelling in Australia to make it between Auckland and Singapore, suggesting it is not likely to be a very sustainable plane.SUPPLIED/StuffJacinda Ardern witnesses the signing of several memoranda of understanding between Singapore and New Zealand. She told media if more sustainable fuels were available she was sure the Air Force would be keen to use them. The sustainable aviation agreement was one of four different agreements signed between New Zealand and Singaporean agencies or companies on Wednesday. New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE) signed an agreement with Enterprise Singapore aiming to promote trade, while Kiwi foodtech company FoodBowl signed an agreement with the Singapore Institute of Technology. Ardern also announced that Singapore and New Zealand would step up its cooperation on supply chain issues, creating a working group for the countries to collaborate on supply chain technology and policy.SUPPLIED/SuppliedJacinda Ardern met with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday. Singapore is a major hub for New Zealand imports and exports, with a fifth of all exports going through the port. NZTE boss Peter Chrisp said it was good to actually be on the ground in Singapore, after two years of Zoom meetings. “Online is a poor cousin, but it’s better than nothing.” Chrisp said Singapore was a useful country for New Zealand companies to incubate in before selling to a wider global market, as it was roughly the same size of New Zealand but had a very diverse economy with a huge amount of investment capital. “Xero started global – this was the place they came to incubate for a bit before going really global,” Chrisp said. This is Ardern’s last day in Singapore before she flies to Japan on Wednesday night."

The scene of the incident stretched about 230 metres along State Highway 3, between De Havilland Dr and Mountain Rd. Venables said exhibits requiring forensic examination included 15 vehicles and one trailer.LISA BURD/STUFFEmergency services were on Monday at the scene of Saturday's fatal police shooting on State Highway 3 north of New Plymouth. “The examination of those vehicles was completed on Wednesday. “The process of interviewing a significant number of witnesses is ongoing.” The statement said a police unit conducted a vehicle stop on a car travelling along SH3 about 9.30pm. “While police were speaking to the driver of this vehicle, Mr Price has sped past in his vehicle with the headlights off. “He has turned around and driven at high speed toward police, before crossing the centre line and narrowly missing the stationary police car. “He continued down the road before making a second u-turn and driving back toward Police, this time ramming the police car at speed. “The force of the impact shunted the police car off the road. “Mr Price’s vehicle was immobilised due to the damage sustained in this collision.” He was then shot while trying to commandeer a vehicle from members of the public. Venables statement added: “Mr Price was returned to his whānau yesterday [Wednesday] following the completion of a post-mortem. “Police and support services continue to provide support to Mr Price’s family, the community and our staff at this difficult time. “While witness interviews and other enquiries continue police are not in a position to comment further.”"

The finance ministry disagrees and President Vladimir Putin has called on authorities to find a consensus.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told state TV channel Rossiya-24 on Friday that he hoped disagreements could be ironed out and a bill regulating cryptocurrencies passed by the end of the year. He said the government would take the final decision.""I hope that, in the best-case scenario, it could be passed in the spring session,"" Siluanov said, though he acknowledged that broader debates may prolong its passage.Siluanov said his ministry proposed identifying crypto traders, which he said would separate the ""white"" market from the ""grey"" market.Giving law enforcement the power to trace money flows and transactions may diminish one of cryptocurrencies' major selling points - their anonymity.""The Russian government...appears to have taken the position that crypto assets are here to stay and is contemplating legislation with the aim of bringing the industry 'out of the shadows' and creating an opportunity for legal business,"" said David Henderson, senior associate at Browne Jacobson.A document seen by Reuters, however, shows the central bank does not support the ministry's proposals and wants an outright ban on the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrencies.The finance ministry and central bank did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment.Andrey Kladov, former cryptocurrency expert at Russia's Internet Initiatives Development Fund and now engaged in digital banking in South Africa, said their diametrically opposed views could significantly hinder market development, giving time for the grey market to become even greyer.""A prohibitionist stance on it is absolutely useless, like banning umbrellas because 50 years ago someone killed a man with an umbrella,"" Kladov said. ""Everyone has umbrellas and every fifth or 10th person has cryptocurrency.""The central bank estimates the annual volume of cryptocurrency transactions in Russia at about $5 billion.In spite of the dispute, Siluanov said his ministry was working with the central bank to ensure that crypto assets did not appear on banks' balance sheets.(Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Christina Fincher)Vladimir PutinPresident of RussiaAnton SiluanovRussian Minister of Finance and First Deputy Prime Minister"

But paying off ANC salaries with the IMF loan is a major red flag...,thesouthafrican.com,"                                  Tito Mboweni has landed himself in hot water with the opposition on Friday, after he claimed that the multi-billion dollar IMF loan granted to South Africa for COVID-19 relief purposes could also contribute towards ANC salaries.    Tito Mboweni ‘could spend IMF loan on ANC salaries’    The response, submitted for a Parliamentary question fielded by the DA, stated that salary payments could be supplemented by the ‘loan disbursements’. The ANC has failed to pay their workers for several months in this calendar year, and it seems the finance minister is eyeing an escape route through the IMF:    “The loan receipts (or disbursements) will form part of the National Revenue Fund to be used to support existing government programmes, which could include salary payments.”Tito Mboweni    What was South Africa’s IMF loan meant for?    However, this could prove to be quite problematic. The IMF loan was meant to be used for the following pursuits:    The support health and frontline services.Solving the balance of payments problems caused by the pandemic.The protection of the vulnerable.Support for economic reform and job creation.Stabilising the public debt was also listed as a priority.    Plans to pay-off ANC salaries branded “a failure”    Leon Schreiber is the Shadow Minister for Public Service and Administration. He’s outraged that Mboweni has ‘failed to stand up’ to his colleagues, and claims his opposite number has now ‘reneged’ on the terms of the IMF loan.    “It is now public knowledge that his economic reform crusade has been rejected outright by his Cabinet colleagues who have repeatedly shown a willingness to send South Africa over the fiscal cliff through unrestrained spending.”“By admitting that the IMF loan could be used to pay salaries, Mboweni has reneged on the spending commitments he made in his Letter of Intent to obtain financial support under the IMF’s emergency financing instrument. The LOI committed the government to use IMF emergency assistance for things like supporting health and frontline services.”“Tito Mboweni’s failure to hold the line and defend the public purse from marauding political interests in his own party will have far-reaching consequences on South Africa’s long term fiscal stability.”Leon Schreiber                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "

At least 1,600 acres have burned in Boulder County, much of it suburban, with warnings that deaths and injuries were likely as the blaze engulfes hotels and shopping centers. ""We know that approximately 370 homes in the Sagamore subdivision... have been lost. There's a potential of 210 homes lost in Old Town Superior,"" Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told a news conference. ""I'd like to emphasize that due to the magnitude and intensity of this fire and its presence in such a heavily populated area, we would not be surprised if there are injuries or fatalities."" Thousands of people have been told to flee the fast-moving fire, which is thought to have begun when powerlines were toppled by gusting winds. The 20,000-strong town of Louisville, along with the 13,000 residents of Superior, have been told to get out, with the National Weather Service describing the situation as ""life-threatening."" Wind gusts of over 100 miles (160 kilometres) an hour have been reported in some places, fanning the flames and complicating firefighting efforts. ""Prayers for thousands of families evacuating from the fires in Superior and Boulder County,"" Colorado Governor Jared Polis tweeted. ""Fast winds are spreading flames quickly and all aircraft are grounded."" Like much of the American West, Colorado is in the grip of a years-long drought that has left the area parched and vulnerable to wildfire. Although fires are a natural part of the climate cycle, and help to clear dead brush and reduce disease in vegetation, their scale and intensity is increasing. Scientists say a warming climate, chiefly caused by human activities like the unchecked burning of fossil fuels, is altering weather patterns. This prolongs droughts in some areas and provokes unseasonally large storms in other places, phenomena that are expected to get worse as worldwide average temperatures continue to climb. Daniel Swain, a meteorolgist at the University of California, tweeted that it was ""hard to believe"" these fires were taking hold in December, usually a quieter time for blazes. ""But take a record warm & dry fall, only 1 inch of snow so far this season, & add an extreme (100mph ) downslope windstorm...and extremely fast moving/dangerous fires are the result."" "

The Ulster side essentially had the game won by the break when they led by nine points. It was Armagh’s first win over the Dubs at headquarters since 2003 when they beat them in an All-Ireland qualifier. And it was their first win over any opposition at Croke Park since beating Kildare in an All-Ireland qualifier in 2017. No wonder their fans celebrated when the final whistle sounded. It was a disastrous night for Dublin and their manager Dessie Farrell. This is the first time that Dublin have lost back-to-back competitive matches in Croke Park since 2009-2010 (beaten by Kerry in ’09 All-Ireland quarter-final and by Tyrone in first round of 2010 league).  On paper this seemed a ‘gimmie’ two points for Dublin ahead of their trip to Tralee to face Kerry next Saturday night. Now this game has taken on huge significance though the season is still in its infancy. This was a perfect start to Armagh’s second season back in the top-flight. Securing points on the road is a bonus in Division One. It is doubtful if even the Armagh fans thought it possible. Their last league win over Dublin came in a Division Two tie in 2008 and in their last meeting in the competition four years later they endured a 16-point drubbing. Now in his eighth season at the helm, Kieran McGeeney is finally reaping the benefits of his painstaking team-building project. Crucially their often-suspect defence passed the test. Of course, it’s only January and the first round of the league. But Armagh could not have dreamed of a better start to the 2022 campaign. The Athletic Grounds will be throbbing next Sunday when they host All-Ireland champions Tyrone in round two.   Having won the O’Byrne Cup with three comfortable wins, Dublin appeared to be back on track. But all the doubts which surfaced last summer, culminating in a meltdown in the final quarter and in extra time against Mayo, came back to haunt them again.   Armagh joint captain Rian O’Neill was yellow carded after 90 seconds after he flattened John Small as both sides withdrew virtually all their outfield players behind the ball once they lost possession. Dublin were content to repeatedly recycle the ball as they probed to find an opening through the massed Armagh defence. But ultimately it was a long-range point from Brian Howard which produced the game’s first score after nine minutes. Twice in the first 15 minutes it took perfectly executed blocks by the Dublin defence to stop Armagh shots on goal as Dublin patiently built a 0-3 to 0-1 lead. But Armagh underlined their attacking prowess by not just wiping that advantage out but taking a four-point lead after blitzing Dublin with an unanswered 1-3 in a four-minute spell midway through the half.  Though unforced errors from Dublin contributed, it was the excellence of O’Neill which was central to the scoring surge. Dublin full-back David Byrne was caught in no man’s land by a terrific 50 metre foot pass from Aidan Nugent and O’Neill calmly slotted the ball past Evan Comerford. O’Neill hit a terrific long-range point and though Dublin replied through Costello and Ciaran Kilkenny the Dublin defence was carved open again in the 27 th minute. After O’Neill provided the assist, Jason Duffy brilliantly lobbed Comerford for Armagh second goal. Having lost Aaron Byrne in the 16 th minute, Dublin also had to replace the injured Cormac Costello, with Dean Rock making his seasonal debut. But he was short with two long range frees as Armagh continued to shred the Dublin rear guard. Armagh lost midfielder Ben Crealey just before the break but led by nine points at the half (2-8; 0-5) with their full forward line scoring 2-5 against a feeble Dublin full-back line. Dublin also kicked five wides compared to two for the visitors. There was a lot more urgency about Dublin at the start of the second half as they won three Armagh kick-outs on the spin and hit points from Rock (free) and Kilkenny. The visitors were content to slow the play down at every opportunity and Dublin didn’t help themselves with Lee Gannon giving away a completely unnecessary free after the ball had gone out of play and Rory Grugan tapped over a simple free in the 46 th minute.  Connaire Mackin hit their first point from play in the second half soon afterwards but though Dublin replied with two frees it was back to a nine-point game by the 54 th minute after brace of wonderful points from Stefan Campbell and Tiernan Kelly. With ten minutes left Dublin finally got a lifeline via a ‘hit and hope’ shot, which bounced around in the square before substitute Lorcan O’Dell – whose initial effort was blocked – hit a second shot which deflected off a prostrate Ciaran Mackin and over the line. Armagh subs Greg McCabe and Niall Grimley hit critical points for Armagh coming down the stretch and the former also hit the Dublin bar with a thunderbolt of a shot. Apart from the scoreline, the only telling statistic was that Dublin hit 14 wides compared to Armagh’s three. The official attendance was 22,704.

Then aged 29, Twigg left the sport, and it seemed the 2014 world champion and five-time medallist at world champs would depart without making the podium at an Olympics. But she returned in 2018 and was unsurprisingly delighted with how her first race in Tokyo at the relatively untried Sea Forest Waterway course evolved. “It's definitely a lung-buster. A few nerves going into it, but that's to be expected in an Olympic Games. It's good to get underway,” Twigg said. “It felt pretty special; it's been a long time coming.” Other heat winners included 2018 and 2019 world champion Sanita Puspure of Ireland in 7:46.08 and Hanna Prakatsen of the Russia Olympic Committee, the current European champion and surprise package at this year’s World Cup, in 7:48.74. Twigg was wary about reading too much into the respective times though on a hot morning with good water conditions. “These early races, nobody really shows their cards. “Coming back my motivations have changed, trying to remember why I was doing it. All the messages back home have been amazing.”Buda Mendes/Getty ImagesBrooke Donoghue and Hannah Osborne of New Zealand won their women's double sculls heat at the Tokyo Olympics at Sea Forest Waterway. Brooke Donoghue and Hannah Osborne also produced a powerful display on Friday against quality opposition to win their women's double sculls heat and advance to the semifinals. Four of the five New Zealand boats in action on the official opening day of the Games made it safely through to the next stages. Donoghue and Osborne won their heat in a time of six minutes 53.62 seconds, heading off the United States by 2.03 seconds, to advance directly to the semis, which were to be raced on Monday, but will now be raced on Sunday. There will be great interest in Saturday’s rowing, which will now include a number of races that were set to be raced a day later, but have been bought forward at short notice. Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler will race in heat three of the women's pair at 12.40pm. The defending world champs (from 2019) will be expected to win heat three ahead of Spain to advance directly to the semifinals as they aim to limit the amount of races required in Tokyo as they chase double gold. They are also two of the 10 rowers on hand in Tokyo for the women’s eight, who will have their heat at 3.20pm, a day earlier than expected. The NZ men’s pair of Brook Robertson and Stephen Jones will also contest their heat on Saturday, at 1pm, as will the men’s eight, at 3.10pm.

Key dates: Heats start Friday 23 July; double sculls finals, Wednesday 28; pair finals, Thursday 29; single sculls, eights finals Friday 30. Recent Olympics: Five medals at the 2012 London Olympics, including three gold – Mahe Drysdale in the men's single sculls, Hamish Bond and Eric Murray (men's pair), and Joseph Sullivan and Nathan Cohen (men's double sculls). Three medals at Rio 2016, including repeat golds for Drysdale and Murray and Bond. Outlook for Tokyo: Rowing is again expected to be a leading medal provider for the NZ team in Tokyo. The country's women rowers in particular are poised to lead the way, with Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler chasing gold in both the pair and the eight.

Picture taken June 10, 2020. REUTERS/KhamHANOI (Reuters) - Stuck at home with school suspended, Nguyen Doi Chung Anh made the most of a lockdown in Vietnam by using art to demonstrate tragedy, resilience and chaos in the world’s battle against the coronavirus. The work of 10-year-old Chung Anh shows how events unfolded globally, depicting the devastation with drawings of the coronavirus attacking landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, Big Ben and the Leaning Tower of Pisa as it spread through Europe, the United States and beyond. Her pictures also aim to highlight Vietnam’s success in containing the virus after a wave of imported infections, one with a virus-hit passenger plane in the arms of two soldiers and another showing the same flight intercepted by medical workers who spray disinfectant from fighter jets. They refer to the fated flight VN54 which brought in a fresh batch of infected people after Vietnam had declared itself virus-free for three weeks. The country has reported 332 cases and no deaths. Chung Anh drew herself in one picture about her safety to show appreciation for frontliners, who appear in most of her 11 drawings fighting the virus with shields or blasting it with disinfectant. “I drew this with hope that they can keep their spirits high to prevent an outbreak,” she said. “This girl is me, here I am drawing and these things are my imagination.” Several pictures feature the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship aboard which hundreds of passengers were infected, and Li Wenliang, the late Chinese doctor and one of the most visible figures of the pandemic, who was reprimanded when he issued early warning about the virus. Chung Anh’s mother, Doi Xuan Hieu, chose that as her favourite. “I was touched seeing that she can sympathise and acknowledge the sacrifice of the doctors who risked and lost their lives,” she said.

But behind the scenes the UK and Scottish Governments are working constructively.” The Scottish Secretary said he will speak to all of the Tory leadership contenders about their approach to Scottish issues, accusing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of being “wrapped in grievance”.  He added: “I’m not going to publicly back any of the leadership candidates, I will, however, have detailed discussions with all of them about their approach to Scotland, and how we continue to strengthen the Union.” “My message to them is simple: The UK Government’s work in Scotland must be nurtured and accelerated.” READ NEXT:   "

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved. They must also not promote any commercial business, involve any person or organization that promotes hatred of any person or class of persons or otherwise involves illegal activity or contain any “inflammatory, obscene or libellous statement.”  In an emailed statement Monday, the city said the intent of  proclamations is to “celebrate and recognize organizations and events that are meaningful to our community and its residents.” Part of the evaluation process considers if the organization requesting the proclamation is local or has a provincial chapter, it continued.  A two-page city document that can be found online  regarding proclamation requests and the associated bylaw states the event being proclaimed must be relevant to Regina or Saskatchewan. The city was unable to provide any documentation that outlines criteria in further detail as of press time.  "

""Some things are likely to be more difficult over the next few months than they are in the summer,"" Merkel said. ""We have all enjoyed the freedoms and relative protection from aerosols in the summer, which is possible through life outdoors,"" she said, referring to micro-particles that are thought to spread through the air, especially in enclosed spaces. Merkel's comments came after she agreed a wave of new measures with the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states on Thursday designed to combat rising case numbers in Germany blamed mainly on summer travel and private parties. The measures include a minimum fine of €50 for anyone caught without a face mask in places where wearing one is compulsory, a ban on large events until the end of the year and new quarantine rules for travellers.  ""We will have to live with this virus for a long time to come. It is still serious. Please continue to take it seriously,"" Merkel warned. ""Not everything will be the same as before the pandemic, it will hit us hard and existentially,"" she added. Germany has fared relatively well in its battle to contain the virus so far but like many other European countries has seen a new surge in cases in recent weeks. On Friday it reported 1,571 new cases, bringing the total to 239,507, according to the Robert Koch disease control institute.  The country has so far recorded 9,288 deaths.Independent journalism costs money.

He died two years later.- 'On our terms'-Two decades ago, Mugabe seized more than 4,000 farms from the country's 4,500 white large-scale commercial farmers.He justified the land grabs as a way to correct historical wrongs by claiming back land that was forcibly taken from the blacks.Critics blame the land programme for wreaking havoc on the agriculture sector -- a mainstay of the economy.Economic output fell by half following the land seizures and the economy has been hobbled since -- shrinking 7.5 percent last year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in a letter to the IMF in April, projected the economy could contract by between 15 and 20 percent, partly due to the coronavirus pandemic.Food shortages experienced over most of the post-land reform years are widely blamed on the loss of white farmers.The coronavirus pandemic has only worsened the shortages.Two successive droughts have stunted agricultural harvests, leaving 7.7 million, half the population, food insecure.According to the World Food Programme, 56 of the country's 60 districts are experiencing ""crisis"" hunger and the virus pandemic risks driving people into ""deeper desperation"".President Emmerson Mnangagwa has promised to import food to feed them ""so that no one will starve"".For Chinyemba, the government was right ""repossessing"" land from the whites, but they deserve compensation, if only for improvements.""I don't feel any remorse at all. The land belongs to the indigenous people. If the whites want to farm, they should do so on our terms.""He said while black ""people were killed,"" when their land was taken from them, but ""in all fairness, (whites) should get compensation"" for improvements.- 'Willing buyer' -For white Zimbabweans, the programme was an invasion of their property. To the blacks, it was the final battle in the country's liberation since they first rose against British colonialists in the 19th century.Story continuesThe land issue almost derailed the negotiations with Britain that led to the birth of Zimbabwe in 1980.Ultimately a deal was struck that the new government would not embark on any land reforms in the first decade in power.After that, a ""willing buyer, willing seller"" principle came into effect with Britain to fund the buying of white-owned farms.But in 1997, Clare Short, then British Secretary of State for International Development told Harare that London had ""no special responsibility to meet the cost of land purchases.""Sporadic invasions of white-owned farms ensued, but the government curbed them, with Mugabe assuring white farmers that ""squatting"" would not be tolerated.Simons said white farmers deluded themselves into thinking they were untouchable and indispensable ""royal game"" because agriculture was key to the economy.All that changed when in February 2000 after a constitutional referendum with a clause that would legalise expropriation of white farms without compensation, was rejected.Days later, veterans of Zimbabwe's liberation war started running white farmers off their land.A year later, the government formalised the reform programme. Farms were either sub-divided into six-hectare plots or handed out whole to blacks.Thirty kilometres west of Harare, 60-year-old Israel Pasipanodya Mushore inherited Rasper farm. But it has not been easy work.In contrast to Chinyemba's, his farm is rundown. What used to be a swimming pool is now a fishpond.Weeds choked the maize crop. His showpiece is a herd of 70-plus cattle.In 2016 government introduced the ""command agriculture"" scheme to supply farmers with so-called inputs -- seeds, fertilisers and insecticides -- and they pay back on harvesting.The scheme brought hope, but not enough.""Equipment and inputs are our biggest challenge; we have no draught power,"" Mushore said.Inputs were not timely disbursed to farmers, or just didn't get to them.Funding remains one of the biggest challenges.Currently all land belongs to the state and farms operate on 99-year leases.Financial institutions refuse to lend in the absence of collateral.""The 99-year lease on its own, in its current form has not inspired confidence to the financiers,"" said Paul Zakariya, who heads the Zimbabwe Farmers Union, which represents over a million small-scale farmers.Ben Gilpin, who lost a farm, agrees.""If the farmers were on the land with title or some bankable entity that is truly tradable and can be honoured by the banks, government wouldn't have to fulfil the role,"" said Gilpin, who is the director of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents mostly white farmers.- Compensation -Zimbabwe's government insists it will only pay compensation for improvements on the farms that were taken and for not the land.John Laurie, 83, lost two farms in 2002, then valued at US$9-million.Now wheel-chair bound and a double amputee, Laurie is one of the farmers' representatives negotiating compensation with the government.""We hope to have an agreement on a global figure for the immovable assets shortly,"" he said.The government has made ""interim relief"" payments to especially old and destitute farmers.Some 800 farmers have so far been paid the equivalent of US$10,000 for each farm lost.But 20 years on, the land reforms remain a work in progress.After carrying out a land audit, government vowed to slash the size of under-utilised large farms and tackle multiple farm ownership.Opinions on the reforms remain split. But even those who lost farms agree the situation where white farmers occupied the best agricultural land while millions of black Zimbabweans were cramped on semi-arid land, was untenable.Economically though, the reforms are widely seen as a failure.Independent economist Tony Hawkins, said agriculture's share of GDP has fallen from about 15 percent to less than 10 per cent.Despite several attempts, AFP failed to obtain a government response.But for the Zimbabwean leadership, Mugabe's farming legacy continues to empower blacks.""Our land reform programme remains a fundamental cog to our independence and sovereignty,"" Mnangagwa said during independence celebrations in April.""To this, there is no wavering or going back."""

Paolo Odogwu finished in the corner six minutes into stoppage time to claim a 27-26 win that scarcely seemed imaginable when they went in at the break 21-8 behind.  It was Odogwu who landed the game’s first points after four minutes but the Chiefs hit back with scores from Tom O’Flaherty, Lewis Pearson and Jack Innard. When Richard Capstick landed a try-scoring bonus point a minute into the second half, his side were 18 points ahead and cruising. But Wasps efforts from Joe Launchbury, Alfie Barbeary and Odogwu’s second concluded a thrilling match. Here’s how our reporter Bobby Bridge rated the Wasps players out of ten… 15. Marcus Watson: Showed adventure from deep and a willingness to attack but was often well marshalled and also knocked on in the second half. 6 14. Paolo Odogwu: Tries at the start and the end of the game were flashes of the Paolo of old before his injury. He finished both well and made a bundle of metres in congested areas. 8* 13. Malakai Fekitoa: His best involvement was his last as he burst through into the 22 making the metres that led to the Launchbury try. Operated well from scraps and produced a good tackle on O’Flaherty too. 7 12. Jimmy Gopperth: The Kiwi’s rushed touchline conversion to give Wasps one shot for victory was impeccably landed and ultimately proved crucial as the game was won by a point. Took the fight to Exeter in the latter stages too. 7 11. Josh Bassett: So close to try from a kick-off after an Exeter fumble, it would’ve been his just rewards as the big winger made plenty of metres (50) and was alert in defence, making 10 successful hits. 7 10. Charlie Atkinson: What a moment for the young fly-half he coolly looped a pass outside for Odogwu to win the game. It required nerves of steel and he executed it perfectly. Showed good feet to make yards and produced a big hit on Lewis Pearson. One kick-off out on the full, but this was a big display from Atkinson. 7 9. Dan Robson: Showed some good game management in the first half to try and keep Exeter playing out of their own half, but a few clearance kicks stayed infield when Wasps could’ve done with a breather. 7 1. Tom West: Replaced shortly after half-time, West held up his end at scrumtime and carried into some heavy traffic. 6 2. Tom Cruse: Had some lovely moments in open play, keeping the ball alive for Odogwuy’s first try and made another side-stepping break in the first-half. Lineouts weren’t perfect as Exeter placed pressure in that area. 7 3. Biyi Alo: On a game of fine margins, he held up Grondona when a try seemed a certainty. Weighed in with 14 tackles and physical carries while also showing good hands on numerous occasions. Emptied the tank before his 55th-minute withdrawal. 7.5 4. Joe Launchbury: After his 40-minute return last week, the Wasps captain went to the hour-mark and went off having scored the ninth try of his club career. 7 5. Elliott Stooke: Big shift from the lock who needs to weigh in with 80-minute shifts while Launchbury finds his way back to full fitness. Kept taking the fight to Exeter in the closing stages. 7 6. Vaea Fifita: The former All Black made plenty of tackles but fell off a few too as Exeter relentlessly targetted the fringes of the breakdown. 6 7. Brad Shields: He is human. Took a bang from a Woodburn carry and didn’t really look the same thereafter and was replaced four minutes after the break. Defended and carried with his trademark grit and determination. 6 8. Alfie Barbeary: Penalised early on and knocked on in the carry, Barbeary looked out of sorts and fell off numerous tackles. But he remained on the pitch and was instrumental in the late turnaround, making yards, beating defenders and scored his 13th Wasps try with two minutes remaining. The way he ended the game really rescued what would've been a disappointing comeback. But it's an 80-minute game and his late contribution was telling. 6.5 Replacements 16 Gabriel Oghre (Cruse, 62’) - 7 17 Robin Hislop (West, 44’) - 8 18 Elliot Millar-Mills (Alo, 55’) - 7 19 James Gaskell (Launchbury, 61’) - 7 20 Ben Morris (Shields, 44’) - 7 21 Will Porter (Porter, 66’) - 7 22 Sam Spink (Fekitoa, 64’) - 6 23 Rob Miller (Watson, 69’) - 6 The bench had a big impact for Wasps, every player contributed something. Whether it was Miller’s big breakthrough the middle of the park or Gaskell’s carries. But Hislop and Millar-Mills arrived to deliver ferocity in the carry and steel in the tackle. Oghre also held his nerve with some big throws under pressure.

Playing without All-Star slugger Aaron Judge and five of his teammates who also tested positive for COVID-19 recently, the Yankees won their second straight against rival Boston after dropping the first seven meetings this year. New York won two of three in a series originally set for four games before Thursday’s scheduled opener was postponed for testing and contact tracing. Boston, which has lost six of eight, left town with a half-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay, and seven in front of the fourth-place Yankees. Taillon (5-4) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings of four-hit ball in his 100th major league start, improving to 4-0 in his past five outings. Chad Green escaped a jam in the sixth to protect a three-run cushion.   Ryan LaMarre, just called up from the minors, added a two-run homer in the eighth — his first with the Yankees and first in the majors since September 2019. DJ LeMahieu extended his on-base streak to 30 games, longest in the big leagues this season, with a single that set up a third-inning run. New York’s no-name outfield of LaMarre, Greg Allen and Trey Amburgey began the night with 12 career home runs — fewest for a Bronx Bombers starting outfield trio since June 10, 1991. Not exactly Mantle, Maris and Berra — but not a problem on this night. Torres hit his fifth homer on an 0-2 pitch from Martín Pérez (7-6) leading off the second. Torres also homered his last time up Saturday night in a 3-1 victory that was called after six innings because of heavy rain. That gave him long balls in consecutive games for the first time since a three-game streak in June 2019. Odor reached on a bunt single leading off the fifth and scored on Greg Allen’s sacrifice fly. He added a two-run homer in the seventh to make it 5-0. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: 1B Christian Arroyo strained his left hamstring in the third when he went into a split stretching for a throw. He was replaced by Bobby Dalbec. It was the first career appearance at first base for Arroyo, who has played all the other infield positions. Before the game, manager Alex Cora said Arroyo had earned more playing time, and he and the team were comfortable with him at first base. … OF/1B Danny Santana (left quadriceps strain) is expected to come off the injured list Monday after finishing a rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Worcester. … All-Star SS Xander Bogaerts doubled twice after sitting out Saturday night with a sore left wrist. He was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth with Boston trailing 7-0. Yankees: RHP Luis Severino threw 30 pitches to hitters, simulating two innings. “I thought he threw the ball really well. Looks strong, healthy,” manager Aaron Boone said. Severino will likely face hitters again in five or six days before potentially beginning a minor league rehab assignment. He hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery, and his return was slowed because of a groin injured sustained June 12 in a rehab appearance. … Boone said RHP Darren O’Day’s season is likely over due to a left hamstring injury. … Boone said all six Yankees players who recently tested positive for the coronavirus are doing pretty well as far as symptoms are concerned. RHP Jonathan Loaisiga, one of those players on the COVID-19 injured list, was expected to fly to New York and rejoin the team by Tuesday, according to Boone. … RHP Michael King (bruised right middle finger) still feels discomfort and won’t throw for another five to seven days. … Amburgey exited after four innings with a right hamstring cramp and was replaced in the lineup by Brett Gardner. … A leaping LaMarre hit the right field wall with a loud thud trying to catch Christian Vázquez’s fifth-inning double and was shaken up. LaMarre was checked by Boone and two athletic trainers, but remained in the game. LaMarre was called up from Triple-A before the game to replace OF Tim Locastro, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a torn right ACL. UP NEXT Red Sox: Shuffle off to Buffalo for the opener of a three-game series Monday night against the division-rival Blue Jays. RHP Nick Pivetta (7-4, 4.30 ERA) faces Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (3-5, 4.34). Yankees: Following an off day, RHP Domingo Germán (4-5, 4.72 ERA) starts Tuesday night at home against Philadelphia RHP Aaron Nola (6-5, 4.53) in the opener of a two-game interleague series.

The leaders of the powerful House Oversight and Homeland Security committees wrote a letter to Inspector General Joseph Cuffari on Monday, detailing the urgent need for interviews with his staff regarding new evidence of alleged efforts to cover up the erasure of Secret Service communications. “We are writing with grave new concerns over your lack of transparency and independence, which appear to be jeopardizing the integrity of a crucial investigation run by your office,” House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote in the letter. They also renewed their calls for Cuffari to recuse himself from investigations of the erased texts. The committees said it has obtained evidence that shows the inspector general's office first learned of the missing Secret Service text messages, as part of its investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol, in May 2021. And that emails between top DHS IG officials show the agency decided to abandon efforts to recover those text messages in July 2021, nearly a year before they first informed Congress they were erased. “These documents raise troubling new concerns that your office not only failed to notify Congress for more than a year that critical evidence in this investigation was missing, but your senior staff deliberately chose not to pursue that evidence and then appear to have taken steps to cover up these failures,” the letter continued. Cuffari sent a letter to the two committees last month disclosing that Secret Service text messages sent and received around Jan. 6, 2021, were deleted despite requests from Congress and federal investigators that they be preserved. The deletion of the messages has raised the prospect of lost evidence that could shed further light on then-President Donald Trump’s actions during the insurrection, particularly after testimony about his confrontation with security as he tried to join supporters at the Capitol. Since that July 19 letter, a series of revelations about the Secret Service and DHS's mishandling of those communications have come to light, prompting a congressional probe into the matter. The letter Monday noted one email, dated July 27, 2021, where Thomas Kait, the deputy IG, wrote to Jim Crumpacker, a senior liaison official at DHS: “Jim, please use this email as a reference to our conversation where I said we no longer request phone records and text messages from the USSS (United States Secret Service) relating to the events on January 6th.” Lawmakers said they want to know why the watchdog officials chose “not to pursue critical information from the Secret Service at this point in this investigation,” and only decided to renew their request to DHS for certain text messages more than four months later, in December 2021. Lawmakers also revealed Monday that Ken Cuccinelli, who was DHS acting deputy secretary on Jan. 6, was using a personal phone at the time, but the inspector general did not report that fact to Congress. Cuccinelli's texts, along with those of then-acting Secretary Chad Wolf, have also been reportedly erased. The lawmakers demanded that the IG's office turn over by Aug. 8 all documents and communications related to the decision not to collect or recover any text messages and related to the deletion, erasure, unavailability, or recovery of text messages from the Secret Service, Wolf, and Cuccinelli. The committees also asked for the agency to make Kait and fellow deputy inspector general Kristen Fredricks available for transcribed interviews no later than Aug. 15.

He will, therefore, not be available to dance to music he can't hear or understand because he will simply have failed to attend the party,"" added Mr Omulele.  Ms Mutua said that ""in as much as I personally don't support any tribal whipping and incitement, it is also wrong to use what one leader said to try and blame it on BBI.""  ""No one will stop reggae and the DP and his supporters should come to the BBI meetings and air their views too,"" Ms Mutua said.  THREATS  Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo cautioned Dr Ruto against issuing threats over the BBI drive.  ""Let him stop his threats and pettiness. No one can stop a mass movement,"" said Mr Odhiambo.  On Sunday, Dr Ruto told leaders, whom he did not name, that Kenya is a God-fearing nation and that a few self-centred people will not be allowed to plunge it into political turmoil.  ""When the leaders spoke at Narok's BBI rally, they spoke of dividing Kenyans. As the government, this is not what we want.""  He stressed that the BBI is meant to unite Kenyans, not divide them.  After violence was witnessed at the BBI rally in Kitui County, DP Ruto noted that this is not the way to approach the debate.  He said bridges cannot be built with violence and that each person has a right to be heard as the BBI matter concerns all Kenyans.  "

Now, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction  Israel's border fence with Syria, March 2019.  Gil Eliahu  Recent events on the Syrian border express what Military Intelligence has described over the past two months as the establishment of a new deterrent. Iran has decided to act against any attack it attributes to Israel, whether against Iran or organizations linked to it in the Middle East. At around 5 A.M., members of a Shi’ite militia fired four rockets from Syria into Israel in the northern Golan Heights; an Iron Dome battery intercepted all four and there were no injuries or damage.  skip - Haaretz Weekly Ep. 49  The rocket fire in September  was declared an Iranian response to an airstrike attributed to Israel against members of a Shi’ite militia in  near the Al-Bukamal border crossing with Syria. The airstrike happened at the end of August, after a day when airstrikes took place in Syria as well (near the Israeli border) and in Lebanon (in Dahiyeh, the Shi’ite neighborhood in south Beirut).  But in recent years, many attacks have been attributed to Israel and the Iranians responded in only a few cases. This time, according to intelligence, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction. So what was the explanation for the rockets before dawn Tuesday?  As of now, things aren’t completely clear; both Israel and Iran have remained silent. On Monday, the Israeli intelligence company ImageSat released satellite photos documenting what it calls the rapid construction of an Iranian base near the Al-Bukamal crossing.  There are also reports in the Arab media, of questionable credibility, of an incident at the beginning of the week in which a convoy of Shi’ite militias was struck in the desert in eastern Syria west of Deir Ezzor.  A photo released by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq after it launched an attack near the Syrian border, August 2019.  These incidents are happening against the backdrop of heightened preparedness by the Israeli military (which regularly moves Iron Dome batteries between southern and northern Israel), ongoing tension in  the Gaza Strip  (after the fighting with Islamic Jihad last week), intensive action by the Israel Air Force and a surprise drill declared Monday by the Northern Command. At the same time, Israel is in a political crisis as the time allotted to  Kahol Lavan chief Benny Gantz  to form a governing coalition draws to a close. This is a period when the dangers of mixing security and political considerations is higher than usual.  But apparently the most important regional development in recent days – and the competition is great – isn’t happening in Israel or Syria, but in Iran. Despite the regime’s harsh steps, above all cutting the country off from the Internet almost completely, the impression is that  the protests against the government  Reports by opposition activists and journalists coming indirectly to international media outlets reveal a major wave of violent demonstrations, organized attempts to use violence to suppress them, the deaths of dozens of protesters and a few members of the security forces, and methodical large-scale destruction of property. The real number of the injured or killed, like the exact scope of the demonstrations, is unclear.  Iranian-American journalist Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for The New York Times, tweeted on Monday night: “I’ve covered Iran for 25+ years. Never seen protests this brazen, this angry, this widespread. This is serious. That’s why there is a total Internet blackout. Regime is scared.” The protests in Iran broke out against the backdrop of the crises  in Iraq  and  Lebanon  , countries under strong Iranian influence.  In recent days, Arab newspapers have been covering their front pages with protests, incidents and mass-casualty disasters from Iran, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan. To some extent, these seem like a reincarnation of the Arab Spring, which was buried by the murderous civil wars that broke out in its wake. But this time, the main address for the protest in some of the countries is Iran, whose influence and power have grown, especially after the Assad regime's victory in Syria.  A gas station that was burned during protests following authorities' decision to raise gasoline prices, Tehran, November 17, 2019.  Abdolvahed Mirzazadeh / ISNA via AP  Ostensibly, recent developments in Iran should encourage Israel after a few months of the Iranians showing confidence and upping their provocations against the Gulf states and the United States. But officially, Jerusalem has been restrained in its public response. Perhaps more surprisingly, that has also been President Donald Trump’s response; in recent days he has been in no hurry to comment on Iran.  This is surprising because Trump has been harshly criticized, justifiably, for his inaction in the face of Iranian military operations. Now, when it seems that his sanctions policy is finally sparking a response in Iran, Trump is mired in political disputes at home.  Israeli defense officials have adamantly refused to predict what can be expected in Iran and are waiting for more information. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies,  has written on the think tank’s website  that right now there are no signs that the Iranian regime is in danger of collapse or is considering flexibility or giving in to Western demands regarding the nuclear agreement, despite the double pressure of protests and sanctions.  Zimmt is very cautious in his predictions; the regime in Tehran has been very effective in suppressing protests. But one lesson of the Arab Spring is the great difficulty in predicting the masses’ behavior during violent clashes and anticipating how protests will unfold.  Israel, by the way, didn’t have to wait for the Arab Spring to reach this conclusion. It learned this quite well during the first intifada, and to a lesser extent at the beginning of the second intifada.  "

Also, nearly 80% of the total new cases have been reported from 90 districts, official data show indicating the second wave is now limited to certain areas needing focused measures and intensive restrictions to control further spread. Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Kerala and Meghalaya are the top five states having maximum number of districts with above 10% test positivity. The northeastern states together also account for 47 districts with high positivity rate. “The second wave has come down in most states. However, some states are still in the midst of the second wave. This heterogeneity, in the large country that we have, has to be appreciated and district specific measures should continue to be guided by test positivity rate,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said. Apart from the 73 districts with above 10% positivity, 65 districts have positivity ranging between 5-10% and rest 595 have below 5% positivity. The overall caseload of active cases have dropped to below 5 lakh cases with only 91 districts now reporting more than 100 cases daily, down from 262 districts in the beginning of June and 531 in the start of May. With average daily tests at 18.30 lakh, the weekly positivity rate now stands at 2.7%. The Centre emphasised on the need for aggressive testing, particularly in states with large number of districts with high test positivity and fresh Covid-19 cases. “Testing has played a key role in our fight against the pandemic and it has to continue. Currently, we are doing 1,400 tests per million, which is 10 times the recommendations of the WHO, but we should continue because during the second wave, much of our public health response was guided by test positivity rate and that really helped us bring this wave down very fast,” Bhargava said.

As an integral part of the sample preparation process, this workflow relies on SPT Labtech’s apricot PP5 multi-channel pipettor and dragonfly® discovery dispensing platform for low-volume reagent dispensing. In this webinar, the featured speaker from Personalis will discuss the library prep workflow for advanced genomic sequencing. The dispensing platform is used to make reagent plates for the DNA library prep process, with reagents taken from tubes as the source labware. The multi-channel pipettor is then used to take out the reagents from the source plates into the sample plates and perform the assay steps, including sample mixing, bead resuspension, supernatant removal and ethanol (EtOH) washes. Join this webinar to learn about the advantages of automating an advanced genomic sequencing workflow with a next-generation liquid handling platform. Join Mellonie Zhang, Process Automation Engineer, Personalis; and Chris Waddling, US FAS Manager, SPT Labtech, for the live webinar on Wednesday, May 18, 2022, at 1pm EDT.

Incessant attacks on Raila are a direct attack on Uhuru and his government,"" added Mr Osotsi.  MPs Chris Omulele (Luanda), Florence Mutua (Busia County) and Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) said the BBI train had taken off and only the two principals -- President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga -- with the support of Kenyans can stop it.  ""The Deputy President should wake up and smell the coffee. BBI is bigger than him. It is a national re-evaluation of our ethics, cohesion and aspirations,"" Mr Omulele said.  He added: ""It was mooted by the President and Mr Odinga on behalf of Kenyans and the DP does not need to be reminded of this.""  ""If the DP imagines that the BBI is about him and his personal ambitions, he has missed the train by a mile. He will, therefore, not be available to dance to music he can't hear or understand because he will simply have failed to attend the party,"" added Mr Omulele.  Ms Mutua said that ""in as much as I personally don't support any tribal whipping and incitement, it is also wrong to use what one leader said to try and blame it on BBI.""  ""No one will stop reggae and the DP and his supporters should come to the BBI meetings and air their views too,"" Ms Mutua said.  THREATS  Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo cautioned Dr Ruto against issuing threats over the BBI drive.  ""Let him stop his threats and pettiness. No one can stop a mass movement,"" said Mr Odhiambo.  On Sunday, Dr Ruto told leaders, whom he did not name, that Kenya is a God-fearing nation and that a few self-centred people will not be allowed to plunge it into political turmoil.  ""When the leaders spoke at Narok's BBI rally, they spoke of dividing Kenyans. As the government, this is not what we want.""  He stressed that the BBI is meant to unite Kenyans, not divide them.  After violence was witnessed at the BBI rally in Kitui County, DP Ruto noted that this is not the way to approach the debate.  He said bridges cannot be built with violence and that each person has a right to be heard as the BBI matter concerns all Kenyans.  "

The direct-to-consumer furniture company came up with a proprietary couch design that was easy to customize, easy to ship (in easy-to-handle boxes) and easy to assemble (easier than IKEA). Design has always come second, in service of that simplicity.                   However, in the DTC landscape, we’ve seen many try their hands at this formula with less than spectacular results, whereas Burrow has been able to offer up furniture worthy of a central spot in your living room and which may just get compliments from guests. Now, that success has led them to their next adventure: the bedroom.On Tuesday, Burrow launched their new Bedroom collection, which does include bed frames in various finishes and dressers in various drawer-configurations — the pieces we’d expect to see from them — but also something we didn’t expect: two of their own in-house mattresses. It wasn’t enough for them to take on all the other furniture disruptors, they had to take on the mattress disruptors as well.                               The flagship product of the new line is the Circa Bed, which can be customized to suit your needs, from size (full, queen, king) to headboard style (wood, fabric, no headboard). We say yes to the headboard and the wood finish — whether you choose the lighter oak or the dark brown walnut color depends on the rest of your bedroom.                        To go with the Circa Bed, Burrow is launching the Lyric Mattress in two configurations.  Burrow                        Speaking of, they’ve designed the Prospect Dresser to match your bed, as it’s available in the same wood finishes. But the beauty of this piece is that they don’t simply offer the traditional squat design that you’ll see from most other brands. Yes, they offer one that’s three drawers tall, but they also give you the option of a taller five-drawer dresser — another sign that they’re conscious of providing storage solutions to both four-bedroom homeowners and studio-apartment dwellers. (I don’t know who will need the absolutely massive three-column, five-row, 15-drawer dresser, but they’re thinking about all of you hoarders, too.)                                                   The most intriguing addition is the Lyric Mattress, which is available in an all-foam design or a hybrid option for those who want the stability of springs, though Burrow opts for “individually-encapsulated coils” that look like a bunch of little batteries under the foam. It’s a difficult prospect, we’ll admit, thinking about buying a brand-new mattress design that doesn’t have third-party testing to back it up, but there are a couple ways they’re enticing people to try. For one, they’re undercutting the prices of similar models at Casper, the leading name in the DTC mattress space, and offering a 100-night trial period.                         The Knuckle Table Lamp, part of a curated Tala lighting collection.  Burrow                  Where, you may be asking, is the whimsy? The excitement? The piece that can turn your bedroom from a snoozefest into a dreamscape? For that, Burrow tapped Tala, a London-based lighting design outfit. As part of the Bedroom collection, Burrow offers up a few of their striking lamps for sale, the best of which is called the Knuckle. It’s a sort of bizarro Edison lamp that offers a welcome dose of electrical eccentricity. (They’ve also tapped another outside brand, Sijo, for their bedding.)If, however, you’re just here for Burrow’s signature simplicity, they’ve certainly hit the nail on the head with the rest of this collection (no nails required).

200870857,2020-04-05 10:39:48.296397+00:00,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2020/04/liverpools-furlough-decision-socialism-for-the-rich/,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2020/04/liverpools-furlough-decision-socialism-for-the-rich/,Liverpool’s furlough decision: Socialism for the rich,No description,thisisanfield.com,"    Like Tottenham and Newcastle, Liverpool have turned to the government’s furlough system to pay staff in the coronavirus pandemic, but it is patently wrong to do so. Liverpool released a “COVID-19 update” on Saturday afternoon, announcing that some of the club’s non-playing staff will be placed on furlough.  The move will apply to around 200 workers who have been affected by the lack of football being played as well as the closing down of club shops and other operations while the Premier League is on hold. The announcement stated that the club will continue to make sure these staff members receive 100 percent of their wages. What wasn’t clear was the fact that 80 percent of these wages, up to a monthly cap of £2,500, will be paid for by the government and, ultimately, the taxpayer, with Liverpool topping up the other 20 percent—or more in the event any of these workers are on more than £2,500 per month. “Liverpool FC has placed some staff who are impacted by the Premier League suspension on furlough,” read the statement. “The club has confirmed those staff will be paid 100 percent of their salaries to ensure no member of staff is financially disadvantaged.  “Last month the club also confirmed that it would pay its matchday and non-matchday staff while the Premier League is suspended.”  Though the 80-20 split wasn’t indicated in this statement, perhaps intentionally, the use of the word “furlough” reveals that they will be using the government scheme. For a club owned by a billionaire to be using government money, state money, ultimately taxpayer money, in order to make up for some of their losses during this time is, to put it mildly, irresponsible.  It is especially so when as much money and resources as possible are desperately needed in those areas of society tackling the coronavirus head on, and dealing with the numerous issues it raises for the most vulnerable within communities.    The club does a lot of good work in the community through Red Neighbours and supports numerous local charities and organisations, but a cold-hearted business manoeuvre such as this must be disheartening for those involved in these areas, as well as for many supporters. Given the awareness shown by several players, as well as manager Jurgen Klopp, around such issues, there might be a number of people throughout the club who won’t be too pleased with this decision.      Players have led the way  A large, anonymous contribution recently made to a Glasgow foodbank was believed to be from Andy Robertson.  No PR spin, no publicity, just a contribution to where it was needed from someone with money to spare and remembers their roots.  Robertson probably hated the fact that the Times found out he was the source of the donation.    The Liverpool squad, along with Red Neighbours and the LFC Foundation, contributed £40,000 to Fans Supporting Foodbanks—an increasingly vital resource as shopping for supplies has been difficult even for those who can afford them, let alone those who need to use foodbanks. Then, Jordan Henderson led the call for Premier League players to give up some of their salaries to help the NHS and various causes during this time, which would mean they still receive their wage as normal, so their tax would still be paid as normal, but they would be giving money to where it is most needed. The club’s move to take taxpayer money to pay wages which are a drop in the ocean to them is undoing these positive contributions from the players, both financially and ethically.    This is part of the reason the players, via the PFA, have not bowed to the pressure being put on them to take a wage cut. It’s a heated topic in the football bubble at the moment. Why don’t the players take a pay cut? The better question would be, why did the Tories target Premier League footballers for criticism, and not the even richer club owners? (Or other larger businesses…) Looking beyond the huge sums Premier League players earn, it’s really no surprise that the Tories’ target was not the clubs and their owners, many of them billionaires, but the players.  Many footballers are from working-class backgrounds. They also happen to be, and/or have worked hard at being, really good at a sport which can earn them a lot of money regardless of their class, background or upbringing.  This doesn’t sit well with right-wing governments who like the money to remain in the hands of the ruling elite, whether they be monarchy, high-ranking politicians, bankers or any of the big businesses and corporations who help them ensure this money remains their hands and doesn’t filter down. Should players be forced to take pay cuts? No. The amount of tax they pay (if they pay it as they should) is useful in itself, and a pay cut would just be saving the owners money rather than it going to where it is needed.  Should those with surplus money (which is most Premier League footballers) be choosing to give their money to where it is needed in order to help during this crisis? Yes, and the PFA have indicated that this is what the players want to do, but they are also aware that a salary reduction would only benefit the club owners, and not necessarily the areas of society most in need of funds. “Taking a 30 percent salary deduction will cost the Exchequer substantial sums,” read a PFA statement on behalf of the players. “This would be detrimental to our NHS and other government-funded services. The proposed 30 percent salary deduction over a 12-month period equates to over £500 million in wage reductions and a loss in tax contributions of over £200 million to the government.  “What effect does this loss of earning to the government mean for the NHS? Was this considered in the Premier League proposal and did the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, factor this in when asking players to take a salary cut?” The NHS should not be seen as a charity, but the fact it has been underfunded for so long comes on the back of 10 years of a Conservative government. Putting the onus on the players is a handy get-out for the Tories and the billionaires they support across all industries.   Socialism for the rich…  Liverpool supporters might have expected their club to be different to the likes of Spurs and Newcastle, and they had committed to paying staff in full for the rest of the season. But even though they are still being paid in full, the club are no longer footing the full amount. Next time someone at ownership level trots out ‘This Means More’, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ or some mention of Shankly’s values, these will now feel like little more than PR platitudes. Hollow marketing slogans. CEO Peter Moore almost admitted as much when, in an interview with Spanish media outlet El Pais, he alluded to using Shankly’s beliefs in their marketing.  “Even today, when we talk about business, we ask ourselves: ‘What would Shankly do?’. What would Bill say in this situation?” said Moore. “He was a true socialist who believed that football consisted of working together. In the marketing department, we met and said: ‘Let’s put this into words’.” What would Shankly do in this situation?  As Mirror columnist Brian Reade pointed out: “Doubt he’d have said let the taxpayer pay some wages when you’ve just made £42m profit.”    The list of companies who shouldn’t be taking this handout which was, according to the BBC, “designed to support firms that have been badly hit,” is long but depressingly unsurprising. And many aren’t even topping up wages to 100 percent as Liverpool are doing.  The likes of Virgin Atlantic owned by billionaire Sir Richard Branson and Topshop owned by billionaire Sir Richard Green (there is a knighthood theme here too), Wetherspoons and McDonalds, are all rich enough to pay workers through this period, but are all turning to state funding because it saves them a few pennies. The rich are big fans of state benefits and socialism at times like this, just as the banks quite liked it when the taxpayer bailed them out in 2008, but they return to their quest of making sure these benefits don’t apply for the poor, or make sure they are vilified for claiming them, as soon as they are out of the mire.    When front-line NHS workers are still without the required personal protective equipment, putting their lives in danger every minute of every day in order to help others, and when the social care sector is more strained than ever, as much state money as possible is needed at the face of the crisis and the support structure behind it.  It is needed in communities like those around Anfield, St James’ Park and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It might ultimately be given by the players, while the clubs take away, yet the players are still the target. It definitely isn’t needed by football clubs and other big businesses run by billionaires who want to save an amount of money which barely registers in their accounts. Even if Liverpool go back on this decision, which may be the right thing to do and be another example of Fenway Sports Group listening to the supporters, this initial decision will still leave a sour taste and alienate even more fans who are getting increasingly sceptical of the way many football clubs are run.

Evenepoel, long-tipped as a Grand Tour winner, put the hammer down through rain and fog and finished 15 seconds behind Vine, who claimed his first career win.Roglic, who took the red jersey on Tuesday but relinquished it on stage five, appeared to struggle on the final climb, the first category one ascent this year, and trailed home in a group of fellow GC contenders one minute and 37 seconds back.Vine produced a stunning late solo effort, catching Ukraine’s Mark Padun within 6.5km of the summit finish and powering through the mist to claim victory.Remco Evenepoel (right) on his way into the red jersey on a wet stage six. Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesEvenepoel leads the standings by 21 seconds from Frenchman Rudy Molard, whose hopes of keeping the red jersey were hampered by a mechanical before he got dropped. Jumbo-Visma rider Roglic, bidding for a fourth successive Vuelta overall victory, is in fourth place overall, one minute and one second behind.While he will not be panicking, losing ground to the dangerous Evenepoel was not in the script. “I didn’t have the legs for the win so I just fought all the way to the finish,” said Roglic. “There is a still a long way and today we lost a bit but hopefully we can gain a bit later on. I see the other riders have got stronger but I didn’t need any proof. Everything’s fine and we go to the next stage.”Vine said winning the stage was a dream come true. “It’s unreal to be able to do that and to that from the GC group is incredible,” he said of his winning breakaway.The 181km stage was always likely to be decided on the final climb, and while Evenepoel did not win the stage, his performance was a massive statement of intent. “I’m really happy and proud to be the leader,” said Evenepoel, winner of this year’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège classic. “What I’m showing today is maybe one of the best things I’ve done on the bike.”"

(Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool, File) Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta was an attempt by the state of Oklahoma to obtain a legal foothold for an “unlawful power grab” and undermine tribal sovereignty, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his dissenting opinion. “Really, though, this case has less to do with where Mr. Castro-Huerta serves his time and much more to do with Oklahoma’s effort to gain a legal foothold for its wish to exercise jurisdiction over crimes involving tribal members on tribal lands,” Gorsuch wrote in his dissent. “The real party in interest here isn’t Mr. Castro Huerta but the Cherokee, a Tribe of 400,000 members with its own government,” Gorsuch wrote. “Yet the Cherokee have no voice as parties in these proceedings; they and other Tribes are relegated to the filing of amicus briefs.” Prior to his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017, Gorsuch served on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Oklahoma. Gorsuch’s dissent highlighted his expertise in the area of Indian law and familiarity with Oklahoma’s history with tribal governments. Gorsuch repeatedly noted that the majority opinion penned by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which granted the state jurisdiction over certain criminal offenses in Indian Country, completely ignored the issue of tribal sovereignty. Gorsuch penned the majority opinion in 2020’s McGirt v. Oklahoma, which found that much of eastern Oklahoma is still Indian land as the Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservation was never formally dissolved. The ruling has caused considerable confusion concerning which entities have jurisdiction for not only criminal matters, but for taxation and regulatory purposes as well. Indian lands are set aside by the federal government for use, possession, and benefit of an Indian tribe, considered a separate enclave from the states, and “as a general rule, state laws do not apply to Indians in Indian country,” according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “Instead, tribal and federal laws apply.” “Tribes are not private organizations within state boundaries,” Gorsuch wrote. “Their reservations are not glorified private campgrounds. Tribes are sovereigns. … Tribal sovereignty means that the criminal laws of the States ‘can have no force’ on tribal members within tribal bounds unless and until Congress clearly ordains otherwise. After all, the power to punish crimes by or against one’s own citizens within one’s own territory to the exclusion of other authorities is and has always been among the most essential at tributes of sovereignty.” The majority opinion disregarded Gorsuch’s citations of statute and precedent, instead finding that Indian lands are part of the state. “States do not need a permission slip from Congress to exercise their sovereign authority,” Kavanaugh wrote. “In other words, the default is that States have criminal jurisdiction in Indian country unless that jurisdiction is preempted.” Gorsuch showed repeated rulings in Oklahoma courts that showed where the state acknowledged its lack of jurisdiction on Indian lands. “To succeed, Oklahoma must disavow adverse rulings from its own courts; disregard its 1991 recognition that it lacks legal authority to try cases of this sort; and ignore fundamental principles of tribal sovereignty, a treaty, the Oklahoma Enabling Act, its own state constitution, and Public Law 280,” Gorsuch wrote. “Oklahoma must pursue a proposition so novel and so unlikely that in over two centuries not a single State has successfully attempted it in this Court… After the Cherokee’s exile to what became Oklahoma, the federal government promised the tribe “that it would remain forever free from interference by state authorities,” Gorsuch wrote. “At various points in its history, Oklahoma has chafed at this limitation,” Gorsuch wrote. “Where our predecessors refused to participate in one State’s unlawful power grab at the expense of the Cherokee, today’s Court accedes to another’s.” Gorsuch cited instances in the past where the state usurped tribal lands for economic gain. “Maybe the Cherokee also have in mind experiences particular to Oklahoma,” Gorsuch wrote. “Following statehood, settlers embarked on elaborate schemes to deprive Indians of their lands, rents, and mineral rights. ‘Many young allottees were virtually kidnapped just before they reached their majority’; some were ‘induced to sign deeds at midnight on the morning they became of age.’ “Others were subjected to predatory guardianships; state judges even ‘reward[ed] their supporters [with] guardianship appointments,’” Gorsuch wrote. “Oklahoma’s courts also sometimes sanctioned the ‘legalized robbery’ of these Native American children ‘through the probate courts.’ Even almost a century on, the federal government warned of ‘the possibility of prejudice [against Native Americans] in state courts.’” The “paternalist overtones” inherent in the state’s claim that it is helping Native citizens “are hard to ignore,” Gorsuch wrote.

Under the order's conditions, renters must sign a declaration that they make less than $99,000 a year, or twice that amount if filing a joint tax return.The order ""does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract,"" according to the CDC's order.Landlords can continue to collect ""fees, penalties or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract,"" according to the order.The order expires on 31 December.As many as 40m people in the US could be at risk of eviction, according to the Aspen Institute, while nearly half of all renters in the US are cost-burdened, or paying more than 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.Protests across the US led by renters, tenant organisations and housing groups have demanded local and federal governments ""cancel rent"" and extend eviction moratoriums.""A uniform, national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent is long overdue and badly needed,"" the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement. ""The very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won't lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration's action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.""The organisation said that while the""eviction moratorium is an essential step,"" it is merely a ""half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,"" according to the organisation.""This action delays but does not prevent evictions,"" the statement said.The order follows a series of executive orders from Donald Trump, sidestepping Congress after it failed to extend federal unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, as locally issued moratoriums on eviction proceedings were lifted and courts reopened their dockets.But the president's order did not immediately halt evictions, despite his emphatic claims last month that renters are ""not going to be evicted"" because of his order.""We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen,"" he said last month. ""We're not going to evict people ... We are not letting people be evicted.""His order, signed on 8 August, directed federal agencies to ""consider"" whether halting evictions are necessary as a health precaution during the pandemic.House Democrats passed two measures with up to $100 billion for rental assistance, but the Republican-dominated Senate has not agreed to take up the legislation.The National Low Income Housing Coalition has urged the president to work with Congress to put in place a national moratorium on all evictions with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and housing vouchers, and another $11.5 billion for emergency resources for people experiencing homelessness.""Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression,"" the organisation's president Diane Yentel said. ""Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless."""

The rally is the first major protest planned since last Monday's unprecedented storming of parliament by largely young, masked protesters -- a move which plunged the international financial hub further into crisis. Hong Kong has been rocked by a month of huge peaceful protests as well as a series of separate violent confrontations with police, sparked by a law that would have allowed extraditions to  mainland China  . The bill has since been postponed in response to the huge backlash but that has done little to quell public anger which has evolved into a wider movement calling for democratic reforms and a halt to sliding freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. Protesters are demanding the bill be scrapped entirely, an independent inquiry into police use of tear gas and rubber bullets, an amnesty for those arrested and for the city's unelected leader  Carrie Lam  to step down. Beijing has thrown its full support behind Lam, calling on Hong Kong police to pursue anyone involved in the parliament storming and other clashes. - Aimed at mainlanders - Sunday's rally -- first mooted on encrypted messaging apps and online forums -- is being billed as an opportunity to explain to Chinese mainlanders in the city what the protest movement is about. It is the first rally to take place in  Kowloon  , across the harbour from the main island, and will begin at 3:00 pm (0700 GMT) in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, which is hugely popular with mainland Chinese tourists. Inside the Chinese mainland, where news and information is heavily censored, the Hong Kong protests have been portrayed as a primarily violent, foreign-funded plot to destabilise the motherland. ""I hope this march can tell mainland people what we are fighting for and plant a seed that opposes the tyranny,"" one user wrote on the Reddit-like LIHKG forum, which has been a key online gathering place for demonstrators. Sunday's rally is not being organised by the same protest group behind three massive peaceful marches, making it difficult to predict expected crowd size or the tactics demonstrators will deploy. The protest will later march to  West Kowloon  , a recently opened multi-million dollar station that links to China's high-speed rail network. The terminus is controversial because Chinese law operates in the parts of the station dealing with immigration and customs as well as the platforms, even though West Kowloon is miles from the border further north. Critics say that move gave away part of the city's territory to an increasingly assertive Beijing. Under Hong Kong's mini-constitution -- the Basic Law -- China's national laws do not apply to the city apart from in limited areas, including defence. Hong Kong also enjoys rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech, protected by a deal made before the city was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. But there are growing fears those liberties are being eroded. Among recent watershed moments critics point to are the disappearance into mainland custody of dissident booksellers, the disqualification of prominent politicians, the de facto expulsion of a foreign journalist and the jailing of democracy protest leaders.  Authorities have also resisted calls for the city's leader to be directly elected by the people. A 79-day occupation of key intersections in 2014 calling for  universal suffrage  failed to win any concessions from Beijing.  "

Graham Yarrow, of Cannon Park Road in Canley, was outraged when his street was left out of a new traffic safety scheme for the area despite raising concerns about speeding cars five years ago. The scheme funded by the University of Warwick will cover neighbouring Cannon Hill Road and three of its side roads - but not Mr Yarrow's road as council officers believed there were no issues there. But in 2017, in emails passed on to the council's traffic management team, Mr Yarrow complained of speeding cars, saying he feared for his young children and even offering to collect evidence of the zooming vehicles. At a meeting to decide on the scheme last week, Mr Yarrow said he didn't know about an informal consultation last year to discuss the scheme, which saw residents of other side roads successfully bid to be included in the plans. ""If I’d have known back then I would have been shouting as loudly as I am now,"" he said.

""We don't want a person to be next,"" he said, adding that he and others on the road fear it will become ""the path of least resistance"" for cars wanting to avoid the 20mph zone and take a shortcut to the A45. At the meeting, council officer Joel Logue acknowledged Mr Yarrow's emails to the authority and apologised that this point wasn't included in an official report ahead of the meeting. He said the information wasn't received by officers making decisions on the scheme and insisted that all residents in the area were made aware of the plans.       Mr Yarrow (centre) with Wainbody councillors Mattie Heaven (left) and Tim Sawdon (right) at last week's meeting  (Image: Cllr Mattie Heaven)   But Mr Logue, backed up by a dialled-in legal expert, said Cannon Park Road couldn't be added to the scheme without expensive re-consultations using public funds. ""This was all agreed previously and got residents' and councillors' support,"" he told the meeting. Mr Logue claimed that the funding from the university wouldn't stretch to the road without watering down the proposals. ""This money was agreed when £100,000 went very far,"" he said. The council's cabinet member for city services, Councillor Patricia Hetherton, agreed with Mr Logue and gave the scheme the green light. She said: ""We try and reach as many people and there will always be someone who says I didn’t know about it. ""We do have this problem of rat-runs around the city. At least in this particular area there’s money to do something about it."" An experimental traffic management order (ETMO) was recommended for the road instead - meaning temporary 20mph signs will be put in place for six months but there will be no physical traffic calming measures such as speed bumps. Wainbody councillors Mattie Heaven and Tim Sawdon were also encouraged to ask the University of Warwick for more funding.       Cannon Park Road at the intersection with Cannon Hill Road, which is covered by the new 20mph zone  (Image: Graham Yarrow)   But Mr Yarrow told the Local Democracy Reporting Service that he felt ""not listened to and fobbed off"" by the council's response at the meeting. ""The only way [we] will slow traffic down is with physical measures,"" he said. He emphasised that he and other residents have no problem with the University of Warwick, and are grateful for their funding of the scheme and engagement with locals. Cllr Heaven, who sponsored Mr Yarrow's petition and was at the meeting last week, said it was ""ridiculous"" the road wasn't included in the scheme. She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""I’m grateful for Cannon Park Road residents for raising the issue and this petition and I will work tirelessly with my two colleagues to get a scheme implemented a soon as we can, as it’s ridiculous to have left this road out of the overall scheme for Cannon Hill Road.""

Border checks are seen at the border between New South Wales and Queensland'These actions could have seriously compromised the health and safety of all Territorians,' Deputy Commissioner Murray Smalpage said in a statement.'What is most disappointing is the action of the former police officer.'We do not discriminate when it comes to disciplining those who fail to abide rules.'The former officer was accompanied by a 28-year-old woman and men aged 26, 27 and 29. They were all quarantined along with two close contacts, women aged 19 and 24.The officer has since started self-isolation and has been slapped with an infringement for contravening an emergency declaration.On Saturday the Territory reported a fresh COVID-19 diagnosis - that of a woman who arrived on a flight from Melbourne.She is the partner of a Darwin man who tested positive on Friday, with the couple now under the care of the local health services.The case takes the total number of COVID-19 infections reported in the NT to 34, all related to international or interstate travel.The Northern Territory government has said it will employ an extra 100 frontline health workers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.The extra staff will allow for ongoing border screening of passengers arriving from interstate and will help manage people in supervised quarantine.They will also be trained in contact tracing.'We know there is no vaccine, there is no cure, and COVID-19 has no end date,' Health Minister Natasha Fyles said.'Our frontline health staff are integral to our response to COVID-19 and they have done an incredible job in trying times.'

Booked for diving late on. 5 Rodri Told off by Guardiola for one backwards pass than put Akanji under pressure and was never at his best. 6 Ilkay Gundogan Couple of loose passes and heavy touches in the first half set the tone for City's struggles. Had to do better with a second-half chance and then let Toney in front of him for the dramatic late winner. 4 Kevin De Bruyne Had his fair share of injury disappointment during tournament football so hard to blame him for being cautious, but bar one spell in the first half he was fairly quiet. 6 Bernardo Silva Bright down the left and almost won a penalty with one fine flick past Henry. Nimble footwork kept Brentford on their toes. 7 Phil Foden Started like he was lacking rhythm, which was understandable after his recent lack of action, but took his goal quite brilliantly. 7 Erling Haaland Have to wonder how fit he was. Did his best to reach a couple of crosses that were just too heavy and did set Gundogan up for a golden chance, but didn't carry his usual threat. 6  Substitutes  Julian Alvarez Had one chance on the breakaway but delayed a decision too long and then passed the ball behind Haaland. 5   READ NEXT: "

LISTED: STUART BAXTER’S MOST USED PLAYERS SINCE JULY    Sections of Kaizer Chiefs fans wanted Stuart Baxter sacked after only one victory in his first eight games. But things change very fast in football, thanks to the Englishman’s five wins in the past seven games. Isn’t that good?    As often is the case for any struggling coach, poor results encourage fans to question your team selection decisions. Baxter was hammered for omitting the club’s beloved youngsters such as Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, Happy Mashiane, as well as Bafana Bafana’s hugely popular defender Njabulo Ngcobo and of course the club’s living legend Itumeleng Khune.    A storm of criticism befell Baxter but he firmly stuck to his guns.    In Baxter’s 16 games so far, 12 players featured in 10 games or more. Read the full story here.

(Courtesy Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project)  The Silver Line to Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County, Virginia, will open on or about July 16, 2020, at least if everything goes according to plan from here on out, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority said.  For the first time, the authority has set an official internal projected opening date for rail service on the six-station second phase of the Silver Line from Wiehle-Reston East to Loudoun Gateway and Ashburn.  “The current date to open the system to the public is July 16, 2020. That is our goal at this point, and we’re working very hard to meet it,” said Charles Stark, airports authority senior vice president for the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project.  “It could be a few days earlier or a few days later. Nothing in the construction world is that exact, but you gotta have a goal, and that’s ours,” Stark said in an interview.  July 16, 2020, is a Thursday, so it is more likely that if construction sticks to the new schedule projections based on a statistical analysis and discussions with the contractors and Metro, the line would open the weekend before or after that.  The long-awaited opening of Phase 2  has been delayed a few times  , and the latest contracts with the company building the stations and tracks actually currently call for the line to be substantially completed this week. The rail yard contract called for it to be done last December.  Metro is noncommittal about the start date, despite being consulted. Several issues remain under review by Metro’s Office of Inspector General, and inspections by the independent Washington Metrorail Safety Commission also continue.  “Metro will establish a revenue start date once the project (including the rail yard) has been completed to our standards and requirements and accepted by Metro for final testing and safety certification,” spokesman Ian Jannetta said in an email.  Metro is projected to take up to two months for final testing and training of its employees once it takes over ownership of the rail line from the airports authority.  Still, Stark is looking forward to an “absolutely fantastic” feeling of seeing the line finally open in less than a year.  “After all of our examinations and statistical analysis, we are confident at this point in time — without any unforeseen situations or problems — that we will be opening in the middle of July of next year,” Stark said.  An internal airports authority report based on June data warned “continuous delays to the completion of track work could potentially impact substantial completion.”  Major construction on the yard is expected to be finished next month. Talks continue on changes likely to see the yard finished by March rather than July.  “There are a few things that they can do and some things that we can do, such as reducing review times of test reports and the final documents that are necessary to attain substantial completion,” Stark said.  The airports authority has also questioned the length of time Capital Rail Constructors, the group building the stations and main tracks, built into its schedule for fire alarm monitoring tests and generally slow construction work.  As of the end of June, the stations and tracks were projected to be substantially completed on May 14, 2020, 68 days sooner than the contractor projected just a month before.  Details of precise safety testing checklists for the new stations, tracks and rail yard are also still in negotiations. Allowing certain tests to be done simultaneously rather than sequentially could shave a significant amount of time off the schedule.  Rail yard testing has already gotten the OK to proceed in phases in order to speed things up, and the internal report projected full train testing in the rail yard will begin by the end of this year.  Safe braking testing has been completed on the tracks between Wiehle-Reston East and the first section of the tracks on the Dulles Greenway. Within the next month, safe braking and train movement testing is expected to expand along the entire line.  Dulles station windscreen fixes are still in the works, along with a number of other construction cleanup issues inspections found needed to be addressed.  Metro is currently reviewing results of core samples on a few concrete panels to ensure there were no problems with road spray exposure before protective sealant was applied.  “The results appear to be acceptable,” Stark said. “That will close out the concrete issues.”  A newly compiled list of top risks to the project — financial and otherwise — was submitted to the Federal Transit Administration on June 27.  rail-tie  and testing issues, financial claims from the contractors tied to construction delays, any new concerns raised by Metro’s safety department, potential contract litigation costs, and code compliance issues with air conditioning in elevator and escalator machine rooms.  "

Schools with poor ventilation can apply from 7,000 units made available, following a further 1,000 Department for Education (DfE) funded units announced in November for SEND settings.      An online marketplace via the DfE provides a route to purchase units directly from suppliers, however these cost up to £1,170.     Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran labelled the 7,000 units ‘paltry’.      See also: Headteachers welcome return of face masks in classrooms     She said: “The safety of children and teachers is of paramount importance, and frankly the Government has never taken it seriously enough.     “The paltry 7,000 air purifiers announced by the Government is not enough.     “They could have already installed one in every classroom in England for around half the money they intend to spend on a new royal yacht.     “It’s time for the Government to make education a priority, instead of treating our children as an afterthought.”      Oxford West and Abingdon MP Layla Moran. Picture: Richard Cave      Rob Pavey, headteacher at Cheney School, said the Headington school is seeking alternative ways to clean the air.     He said: “None of our rooms are badly enough ventilated to qualify, but if we did, it would be major work.     “We’re doing our own tests on what is most effective and what has been having some effect is putting fans in the corner of a classroom, to blow air into the corridor, and opening fire doors to get the air flowing.     “It’s a really simple solution, which the data shows is working.     “It’s intermediate technology and nothing more than a sticking plaster though.     “What we need is professional advice and the funding for that.”     Cheney School headteacher Rob Pavey. Picture: Ed Nix      Ridgeway Education Trust oversees Didcot Girls’ School and St Birinus School – in addition to Sutton Courtenay CE Primary School and Didcot Sixth Form.     The trust’s executive headteacher Rachael Warwick said: “One of the key concerns is ventilation in schools, and it would be great if more ventilation was available.      “If we were to buy air purifiers, that expenditure isn’t refunded to schools.     “There’s a fine balance for us at the moment with the air flow as having windows open all the time makes the classroom cold and difficult for children to concentrate.”     Ridgeway Education Trust executive headteacher Rachael Warwick. Picture: David Fleming      A DfE spokesperson said: “Air cleaning units are not needed in the vast majority of classrooms – only where there is poor ventilation that cannot be easily improved.     “Based on feedback from schools that there are only very few cases where good ventilation is not possible, we are supplying up to 8,000 air cleaning units from next week.     “Together with mass testing, bringing in supply staff and the hard work of schools and teachers, we are confident that our measures will maximise classroom time for students.”  "

Managing partner Eric Holoman will take over her duties as the club searches for a replacement.  “On behalf of ownership and the entire Sparks organization, I’d like to thank Penny Toler for a successful and historic tenure with the organization,” Holoman said. “Penny is a foundational figure in the growth of the WNBA and helped lead our franchise to perennial playoff success and multiple titles. We wish her nothing but the best moving forward.”  The Sparks said in a statement that a national search for a new general manager would begin immediately.  Toler played for the Sparks from 1997-99. During her tenure as general manager the club won WNBA titles in 2001, 2002 and 2016 while qualifying for the playoffs 18 times.  She scored the first basket in WNBA history and averaged 10.0 points, 4.0 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 88 games, 62 of which she started.  The 5-foot-8 guard from Washington, D.C., played at Long Beach State and became the 49ers’ career leader in assists and free-throw percentage at the time. She was the conference player of the year in 1988 and co-player of the year in 1989.  Dan Loumena has worked myriad jobs at the Los Angeles Times since joining the staff in 1996, including as a page designer, copy editor, assignment editor and Web producer. Loumena was part of the first group of print journalists at The Times to delve full time into the wonders of the website, helping the department move into the digital-first, round-the-clock coverage.  Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg could forfeit a guaranteed four years and $100 million in search of a better deal on the open market this offseason.  Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay finally got running back Todd Gurley into something resembling an early rhythm, against the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.  Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw will start Game 2 of the NLDS against the Nationals, and if the series goes five games, he’ll be rested enough to pitch again.  Dabo Swinney makes $9.3 million per year as coach of Clemson’s two-time national champion football team. So you might think he would like to see his players paid for their work. And they are, he says. With an education.  "

यूएपीए: ‘खौफनाक कानून' के इस्तेमाल में टॉप पर है प्रदेश, योगी और भाजपा को लग सकता है तगड़ा झटका ",No description,amarujala.com," देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।   जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।  मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।  वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है। उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।  यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई बेहद सख्त प्रावधान किए गए हैं। इस कानून के तहत केस में अग्रिम जमानत नहीं मिल सकती। किसी भी भारतीय या विदेशी के खिलाफ इस कानून के तहत केस चल सकता है। अपराध कहां पर हुआ है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। विदेशी धरती पर अपराध किए जाने के मामले में भी इसके तहत मुकदमा दर्ज हो सकता है। यह कानून एनआईए को अधिकार देता है कि वह किसी तरह की आतंकी गतिविधि में शामिल संदिग्ध को आतंकी घोषित कर सकती है। पहले यह व्यवस्था थी कि आतंकवाद के किसी भी मामले में संपत्ति अटैच करने की कार्यवाही जांच अधिकारी बिना डीजीपी की अनुमति लिए नहीं कर सकता था। अब एनआईए का जांच अफसर सिर्फ एनआईए के डीजी की इजाजत लेकर कार्रवाई कर सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।    विस्तार   देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।      जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।           मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।      5922 में से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हुआ    वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि

Many seasons saw cancellations early on including the competitive swim season, hockey, basketball and many others. While baseball was allowed to proceed later in the summer, it was still a truncated season compared to seasons prior. Heading into the fall, while it was hopeful sports in southern Alberta would return to normal, that wasn’t the case. Hockey did get a soft launch early in the fall, but it was short-lived, as further restrictions would come down from the province. Central Alberta Hockey League and southern Alberta teams were able to get in a handful of games into November, but after the provincial government made the call to bring stricter measures back into place, it effectively stopped local hockey until the New Year. The biggest heartbreak across hockey was for graduating players who were not able to complete their minor hockey careers. “I hope there is a meaningful season after this break and our players get the opportunity to compete. It would be a shame if our third-year players did not get the opportunity to finish their minor hockey careers properly,” said Lynn Degenstein, head coach of the U18 Taber Golden Suns. Minor hockey associations also expressed their disappointment Grade 12 players did not have a chance to finish strong in their minor hockey careers. “For us, that’s probably been the most devastating thing. We have a number of kids in our association, and we merged with Picture Butte for our U18 group. So between Picture Butte and Coaldale minor hockey, we have several kids who are in their last year. I know a lot of kids came back this year to be able to play with their friends and have that last chance to play. Our association was hoping to bid on provincials this year for U18, like last year when we put in a bid. We feel bad for those kids. We do hope Hockey Alberta creates some opportunities for them to have another year of organized hockey, whether it’s a Junior C season or something. But that’s up to Hockey Alberta to decide,” stated Darren Hurt, Coaldale Minor Hockey president. Football was allowed to play games against teams in their own zone — which gave kids the chance to further develop their skills on the gridiron. And while it was far from a regular season, it was still an overall success considering the circumstances. “This was a season that required a lot more hoop-jumping than any other I’ve been involved in, but in the end, with the help of a fantastic group of volunteers, we were able to give the kids a chance to get out on the field and play,” said Jason Jensen, Taber Minor Football president. “With all they’ve been through with this pandemic, I think that was something that was dearly needed, and made all the hard work worth it. I’d call that a successful year.” Other sports last fall weren’t so lucky. School court sports, gymnastics and figure skating all saw difficulties in getting off the ground due to the pandemic. The lack of local sports has been devastating for kids who count down the days until their perspective sport rolls around and being cooped up for months in a row was not something anybody wanted. But during this time, it’s a great opportunity to reflect on how much local sports mean to small communities in southern Alberta. In Coaldale, the Copperheads mean so much to the community. Just walk into the Snakepit on a Saturday night and tell me the community doesn’t love that team. In Taber, football season is massive and the Ken McDonald Sports Complex is packed for W.R. Myers Rebels games every single game. And Vauxhall has the Academy Jets. Their home tournament near the end of the spring season sees tons of the community come out and support the team. It’s not just about having kids go out and play the game they love, it’s also about each community rallying around one team. And without that over the past several years, it feels like a piece is missing. Now, with restrictions starting to lift slightly and vaccines on the way, the hope to have sports back at the local level is starting to feel like it’s on the horizon. And when it does, don’t hesitate to get out there and support your local teams and athletes. I can guarantee they will be fired up to finally get out there and having the support of the community may be the highlight of many of their sporting careers.                      "

Patrick Gibson/Cochrane Times SunMedia     Article content With tentative support from the Town of Cochrane on significant improvements to the Cochrane High field, those behind the project will now meet with Rocky View County and Rocky View Schools to confirm support.

Article content Should the town, county and school board formalize their commitments and become fully on-board, backers hope to have the project started in June and an artificial turf field ready for Cobras football games a year from now.  “Not only is this going to benefit the students that call the tri-school site their home, this is also going to be of huge benefit for community athletes,” said Tommy Knitter, part of a group of RVS employees facilitating the proposal on their own time. Cochrane High’s football games (and a multitude of other sporting events) are currently played at Bow Valley High’s artificial turf SLS Legacy Field. “We saw [September 10] a football game at Spray Lakes Legacy Field which hosted one thousand fans. This community is ready for a facility that is going to be the home for multiple athletic user groups.” The proposal is for the field in the middle of the ‘tri-school’ site: the Rocky View Schools-owned property along Fourth Avenue home to Cochrane High, Elizabeth Barrett Elementary and Manachaban Middle School. The school board would continue to own and maintain the field and the space would be theirs during the school day, but part of the terms of the town’s contribution would be that it serves as a community-wide space after school. “One of the benefits of [the booking system] is we are not going to be able to give preferential booking to any one particular user group,” Knitter told council. The budget is current projected at $2.4 million including the new field, uprights and scoreboard.

Article content An unnamed individual donor behind the project is offering to fund $1.2 million, with the idea that the town and county would each put up $600,000. At the council meeting, however, it was indicated that the support could be withdrawn soon. “He has continuously made the comment that it has been very difficult to give a $1.2 million donation,” said Knitter. “He has made it abundantly clear to our group that if we are unsuccessful this evening and if we are unsuccessful building this facility at the end of June 2022, that he is going to remove his funding for this project.” As councillors and senior administration discussed the potential contribution and a letter sought by the backers, the idea of ‘support’ versus ‘commitment’ arose. “I think this is just a letter of confirmation, there’s no guarantee, and I think it will get them where they need to be in terms of being able to keep this moving forward,” said councillor Alex Reed. “I’m in support of this, I think this is seed money that’s necessary and needed.” His colleague Susan Flowers shared a similar sentiment. “I, too, think it’s a really great project and I’d like to see it proceed,” she said. “If there’s a way that we can write the letter that doesn’t commit us to the funding, I can only imagine the hours that they’ve put in on the side of their desks trying to make this happen and the frustration when you apply for these big grants and they all get turned down because you don’t have the commitment of your local community. So I’m all in favour if we can find a way to word it that we’re not binded.”    Advertisement       This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.         Article content No one wanted to commit $600,000 that night, but they still had to determine what level of ‘promise’ would help the project continue to be up for consideration. “I don’t they were just here for a symbolic ‘thumbs up,’ I was getting the sense they wanted us to promise them $600,000,” said councillor Morgan Nagel. “To be clear, I think this is a great project. I think this is a great stop-gap, that Horse Creek Park and all of that sports field is a significant and amazing five to ten-year vision, but that’s not going to happen anytime soon and this would be a really good way to help those sports groups soon.” Council and staff eventually landed on wording for a “letter of support”, and that the expenditure should be considered later this year by the next council for the 2022 budget. “I made it clear to them […] I didn’t feel comfortable having them come and ask for $600,000 prior to an election, all the timing, and they were clear that all they needed was for us to be supportive of the project and that we would consider it in the budget,” said mayor Jeff Genung. Those facilitating the proposal are hoping to finalize the plan in the eyes of the school district at a Rocky View Schools trustees meeting September 23 before seeking commitment (or support) from Rocky View County at a meeting October 1.

While Barker didn't win Wimbledon during her distinguished career, the American made sure to give a special mention to her on her final year presenting at the All-England Club. Barker, 66, understandably got emotional during McEnroe's tribute, looking tearful and visibly moved as she received a standing ovation from the 15,000 crowd inside a packed Centre Court.  The former French Open champion has had to shake off a bout of laryngitis to keep presenting this fortnight. Laryngitis is when the voice box or vocal cords in the throat become irritated or swollen.

Are you ready?  This afternoon, when markets are convulsing mere milliseconds after the Fed Announcement, MBS Live members will know what's going on before anyone else. The accuracy and speed of our real-time price stream and alerts is unmatched.  Yesterday brought a brief reprieve for bonds after the first 2 days of the week threatened to confirm a big picture shift toward higher rates (or at least to build a case for such things).  But much like the brief rally in the middle of last week, yesterday's rally proved to be a head fake, only this time, it was even less convincing.  In fact, it took place entirely within the confines of the weeks-long uptrend in rates (white lines in the chart).  Now today, bonds started out in significantly weaker territory after overnight trade headlines rocked both sides of the market (good for stocks, bad for bonds).   subscribers can get caught up with that move  HERE  .  The losses are already pushing the upper limit of the shorter-term trend.  1.90-1.94 is an important line in the sand for yields.  It separates the summertime surge from the rest of the long-term rally with a very clear high in mid-September and a very clear low in early July.  These sorts of inflection points CAN be targeted as ceilings that motivate bond buyers to get more aggressive, but they can also be lines in the sand that signify a shift into a longer term uptrend in rates.  I've been concerned about the latter ever since August's big rally.  By then, yields had fallen far enough and for long enough to put 2019 on par with many other long-term bond rallies.  To make that list, a rally needs to have covered at least 100bps.  The chart below gives examples of the market movement that has followed those rallies.  The 2 best case scenarios are seen in 2011 and 2015.  Of the two, 2011 bears more similarity to 2019.  That is worth some small consolation as we've already almost matched the initial rebound in late 2011.  If the pattern were to perfectly repeat itself (it won't, but just for the sake of argument), yields would soon drop back to recent lows and then rise back up to 1.90%-ish by March 2020.  In more dire scenarios, we're looking at another several months of weakness, and notably, in the 2009/10 example, that could be followed by another 8-12 months of volatile, sideways momentum before the next true rally emerges.  I'm not sayin this WILL happen, but it is something you need to be prepared for.  We don't know how long the weakness will last or how far it will go, but all other things being equal, the size and scope of 2019's rally make weakness more likely than strength for the rest of the year.  A former originator, Matthew began writing for Mortgage News Daily in 2007, covering a wide range of topics.

Iran has decided to act against any attack it attributes to Israel, whether against Iran or organizations linked to it in the Middle East.

On Monday, the Israeli intelligence company ImageSat released satellite photos documenting what it calls the rapid construction of an Iranian base near the Al-Bukamal crossing.  There are also reports in the Arab media, of questionable credibility, of an incident at the beginning of the week in which a convoy of Shi’ite militias was struck in the desert in eastern Syria west of Deir Ezzor.  A photo released by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq after it launched an attack near the Syrian border, August 2019.  These incidents are happening against the backdrop of heightened preparedness by the Israeli military (which regularly moves Iron Dome batteries between southern and northern Israel), ongoing tension in  the Gaza Strip  (after the fighting with Islamic Jihad last week), intensive action by the Israel Air Force and a surprise drill declared Monday by the Northern Command. At the same time, Israel is in a political crisis as the time allotted to  Kahol Lavan chief Benny Gantz  to form a governing coalition draws to a close. This is a period when the dangers of mixing security and political considerations is higher than usual.  But apparently the most important regional development in recent days – and the competition is great – isn’t happening in Israel or Syria, but in Iran. Despite the regime’s harsh steps, above all cutting the country off from the Internet almost completely, the impression is that  the protests against the government  Reports by opposition activists and journalists coming indirectly to international media outlets reveal a major wave of violent demonstrations, organized attempts to use violence to suppress them, the deaths of dozens of protesters and a few members of the security forces, and methodical large-scale destruction of property. The real number of the injured or killed, like the exact scope of the demonstrations, is unclear.  Iranian-American journalist Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for The New York Times, tweeted on Monday night: “I’ve covered Iran for 25+ years. Never seen protests this brazen, this angry, this widespread. This is serious. That’s why there is a total Internet blackout. Regime is scared.” The protests in Iran broke out against the backdrop of the crises  in Iraq  and  Lebanon  , countries under strong Iranian influence.  In recent days, Arab newspapers have been covering their front pages with protests, incidents and mass-casualty disasters from Iran, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan. To some extent, these seem like a reincarnation of the Arab Spring, which was buried by the murderous civil wars that broke out in its wake. But this time, the main address for the protest in some of the countries is Iran, whose influence and power have grown, especially after the Assad regime's victory in Syria.  A gas station that was burned during protests following authorities' decision to raise gasoline prices, Tehran, November 17, 2019.  Abdolvahed Mirzazadeh / ISNA via AP  Ostensibly, recent developments in Iran should encourage Israel after a few months of the Iranians showing confidence and upping their provocations against the Gulf states and the United States. But officially, Jerusalem has been restrained in its public response. Perhaps more surprisingly, that has also been President Donald Trump’s response; in recent days he has been in no hurry to comment on Iran.  This is surprising because Trump has been harshly criticized, justifiably, for his inaction in the face of Iranian military operations. Now, when it seems that his sanctions policy is finally sparking a response in Iran, Trump is mired in political disputes at home.  Israeli defense officials have adamantly refused to predict what can be expected in Iran and are waiting for more information. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies,  has written on the think tank’s website  that right now there are no signs that the Iranian regime is in danger of collapse or is considering flexibility or giving in to Western demands regarding the nuclear agreement, despite the double pressure of protests and sanctions.  Zimmt is very cautious in his predictions; the regime in Tehran has been very effective in suppressing protests. But one lesson of the Arab Spring is the great difficulty in predicting the masses’ behavior during violent clashes and anticipating how protests will unfold.  Israel, by the way, didn’t have to wait for the Arab Spring to reach this conclusion. It learned this quite well during the first intifada, and to a lesser extent at the beginning of the second intifada.  "

Another 19 cases came from the neighboring North Gyeongsang Province towns.  The country has also reported 11 fatalities from the virus, mostly at a hospital in the county of Cheongdo, near Daegu. Many of the cases have been tied to a Daegu church and authorities were tested its local members.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier called for Americans to be prepared for the illness to spread there, adding new urgency to response efforts that had long focused on China and its Asian neighbors.  ""It´s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen - and how many people in this country will have severe illness,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a call with reporters Tuesday.  Chinese officials have reported a slowing in the number of new cases in recent days but it still has most of the world's 80,000 cases and 2,700 deaths.  New outbreaks were being reported, however, in places as far-flung as Italy and Iran, France and Algeria, and Spain´s Canary Islands. The tiny Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain counted 17 cases, including a school bus driver who had transported students as recently as Sunday.  The head of Iran's virus task force tested positive for the virus just a day after urging the public not to overreact about its spread. Iraj Harirchi posted a video online later, promising authorities would bring the virus under control within weeks.  But a ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, said it could take at least until the Persian New Year's holiday on March 20, or as long as late April, to contain the disease. ""We don't expect a miracle in the short term,"" he said.  The World Health Organization said the fatality rate for the new COVID-19 illness was between 2% and 4% in Wuhan, the city where the illness was first detected late last year, and 0.7% elsewhere in China.  The reason for the discrepancy was partly because the disease hit Wuhan early and fast, when ""people didn´t know what we were dealing with, were learning how to treat this,"" Dr. Bruce Aylward, a WHO envoy who led a team just back from China, told reporters Tuesday.  At the beginning of the outbreak, ""people were finding severe disease, that´s why the alarm bell went off,"" Aylward said. But now with more aggressive testing, mild cases are being diagnosed and isolated.  In Italy´s north, where more than 200 people were sickened, a dozen towns were sealed off and police wearing face masks patrolled. Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza huddled in Rome with counterparts from bordering countries - France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia - as well as with those from Germany and Croatia, two countries whose citizens are among frequent visitors to Italy.  Among the shared views emerging from the meeting, Speranza told reporters, was this one: ""Closing borders is inappropriate"" as a response. Italian officials reported 322 cases of the virus overall, including 11 deaths.  Croatia and Austria reported their first cases of the virus. And an Italian doctor staying at a hotel in the Canary Islands tested positive for the virus, prompting the quarantine of hundreds of guests.  Croatia, Hungary and Ireland advised against traveling to Italy´s affected area, one of a number of government moves seeking to limit further exposure.  Chonnam National University staff wearing protective attire are on standby for special transportation for Chinese students studying at their university, at Incheon International Airport in Incheon, South Korea  Uncertainly remained over how best to stem the spread of the illness. Italy had taken Europe´s most stringent preventative measures and yet became home to the biggest outbreak outside Asia. Experts in Japan, with one of the world´s most sophisticated health systems, acknowledged the country´s handling of a virus-stricken cruise ship was flawed and could have allowed the problem to magnify.  Japanese officials said they would urge a change to the country's deeply ingrained work culture in a bid to stem the illness. The government urged employers to allow workers to telecommute and have more flexible hours, simple moves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed hope could help control the spread.  Japan's case total of 860, third highest behind China and South Korea, includes 691 passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess. Four former passengers on the ship have died and more than a dozen people who were evacuated by their home countries later tested positive for the virus. Six government officials involved in the quarantine effort also became sick.  Overnight, 445 Filipinos who were mostly crewmembers on the ship flew home to begin a quarantine at an athletic facility in a northern province. Eighty Filipino crew members who tested positive for the virus stayed behind in hospitals in Japan.  'Mercy' singer Duffy makes emotional post telling fans she was kidnapped, drugged and raped...which is why she vanished from spotlight  Kim Kardashian throws a punch as fight with Kourtney gets physical in dramatic preview of KUWTK: 'Don't EVER come at me like that'  Eva Mendes says she wants to jump back into acting as a Disney villain... but also admits she's ready for a followup to Hitch with Will Smith  Teddi Mellencamp was 'screaming' in the hospital before an epidural... as RHOBH star documents her day ahead of giving birth to her third child  Prince Harry's final hurrah: Duke arrives in Edinburgh to begin one of his last round of engagements as a working royal before Megxit on March 31   Demi Rose's bright pink bikini can barely contain her ample assets as she enjoys a sun-kissed bike ride on Venice Beach... and cuddles a BUNNY  Cate Blanchett looks stylish in a brown blazer and a black top as she takes part in debate while promoting new series Stateless at Berlin Film Festival  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley nails daytime business chic in a tuxedo blazer with skinny pants and boots as she steps out in Los Angeles  Rita Ora, 29, and Jude Law's son Rafferty, 23, 'SPLIT' just three months after sparking up a romance on the set of Oliver Twist adaptation  That's an expensive lunch!

Govanhill West – part of the First ­Minister’s Glasgow Southside seat – has a child poverty rate of 69 per cent.  That’s the worst in both Scotland and the UK, an investigation by the Sunday Mail has found. It’s followed by ­neighbouring Govanhill East on 58 per cent – the second worst Scots area.  Margo Uprichard, chief executive of Govanhill-based charity the Louise Project, which helps struggling ­ families, said: “Poverty is endemic in Govanhill.  “Over the course of this year, people who are already in­­ ­poverty are going to suffer greatly. We are not in the eye of the storm yet but it is coming.   Read More Related Articles    Read More Related Articles    “We have always had families in crisis in Govanhill but the poverty is going to get worse.”   Three other parts of ­Sturgeon’s constituency were in the 10 worst areas – ­Strathbungo in third, ­Pollokshaws East, fifth, and Pollokshaws West in 10th. The investigation has also highlighted a massive gap in poverty rates. The lowest child poverty areas were Murrayfield in ­Edinburgh, and St Andrews, at one per cent each. In Dean Village, ­Edinburgh, home to the First Minister’s ­official ­residence in Charlotte Square, only four per cent are below the poverty line. The Sunday Mail worked with our in-house Reach PLC Data Unit to analyse figures from the Office for National ­Statistics, ­published for all areas of the UK. It showed 175,009 kids in ­Scotland were below the ­breadline in March last year, up from 158,781 in March 2015 – or one in seven in Scotland. Other poverty-hit areas were ­Dalmarnock, ­Scotstoun and ­Carnwadric in Glasgow, Ladywell in Motherwell and ­Aberdeen East.  Sixty-one per cent – 107,507 – of kids living in poverty last year in Scotland had at least one working parent. ­Scottish Labour spokesperson for social justice and ­security, Pam Duncan-Glancy, said: “What a damning ­indictment of the SNP’s record on child poverty this is. After 15 years in government, child poverty is still rising – even in the FM’s own constituency.” Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: “Politicians are supposed to stand up for the area that elected them. “On the basis of these figures, the First Minister’s constituents have reason to be doubly aggrieved. They are being failed by their local representative and by the leader of the country. “It is scandalous that, after 15 years of SNP governance, the number of people in poverty is on the rise.” Charities have warned child ­poverty is likely to worsen with soaring food and energy costs and the axing of the £20 increase in Universal Credit last October. John Dickie, director of the Child ­Poverty Action Group, said: “It is worrying that many of the children affected have full-time working parents. This shows many jobs are failing to pay a living wage.”   Read More Related Articles    Read More Related Articles    The Poverty Alliance, which represents 350 groups across Scotland, said the ­figures were a shameful injustice. ­Director Peter Kelly, added: “No child should have their life chances restricted and restrained simply because of where they were born.” Imran Hussain, head of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, said: “Unless the Government chooses to shield them now by protecting benefits from rising inflation, it will fail on its manifesto pledge to cut child poverty and millions of families will continue to face years of miserable hardship.” Mary Glasgow, chief executive of the charity Children 1st, said: “It has become almost impossible for many families to make ends meet.” In February we revealed how thousands of children were also made homeless in the pandemic. At one stage, 7900 were living in ­temporary accommodation. Glasgow Southside has been ­represented by Sturgeon since its creation in 2011.       First Minister Nicola Sturgeon  (Image: 2022 Getty Images)   A UK Government spokesman said it is supporting families. He added: “This includes putting an average of £1000 more per year into the pockets of working ­families via changes to Universal Credit, cutting fuel duty and helping households with their energy bills through our ­£9.1billion Energy Bills Rebate.” A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Tackling child poverty is our national mission and we are helping to lift thousands of children out of poverty in Scotland within our limited powers.” He added its Tackling Child ­Poverty Delivery Plan “is backed by new ­investment of £113million on top of ­funding already allocated”. The figures are estimates based on the number of children living in families whose income is less than 60 per cent of the average income as of March 31, 2021, from the Department for Work and ­Pensions and population figures for ­mid-2020 from the ONS. Victor's story A dad of two from Govanhill has told how he is battling to keep his family’s heads above water as prices rise. Victor Surmij, 29, has lived in the area for 10 years after moving from his native Slovakia. He and partner Diana Dimeterova, 24, have seen their weekly food bill rise from £62 to £90 in just a few months. Victor also fears he won’t be able to afford his power bill with recent price rises and is cutting back on his use of gas and electricity. He runs his own ­bakery business in East Kilbride and is able to provide family, including sons Michael, four, and Victor, two, with fresh bread and other bakery items which helps him save cash on groceries.  Read More Related Articles   But he fears for many others living in Govanhill on low incomes who are finding it hard to feed their children. Victor said: “I know of parents who can’t afford to give their ­children simple things like chocolate as a treat. “There is no doubt things will get worse for people here as prices go up. There is a lot of ­poverty and ­unemployment in Govanhill and they struggle to put food on the table.” Another local resident, Livia Rat, 38, who has three children, aged 18, six and one, says it is a daily struggle to feed her family. Livia, who moved to Scotland from Romania three years ago, said: “I do not work and my husband has a job with a car valet. The price of food and heating is going up all the time. “We just manage to get by but worry that things could get worse.”"

Center-left Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese set climate policy as a battle line at elections expected to be held between March and May.                  Prime Minister Scott Morrison was widely criticized at a U.N. climate summit in Scotland last month over his conservative government’s target of reducing Australia’s emissions by only 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.                                                  It was the same target Australia adopted at the Paris summit in 2015, while other wealthy countries have pledged far deeper cuts in a bid to contain global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius.                              Albanese said a change of government would mean Australia would be able to attend the next international climate and “not be in the naughty corner.”                  Australia’s economy was similar to Canada’s and Labor's goal was similar to the Canadian target of reducing emissions by 40% to 45% by the end of the decade.                        “We think that we’ve got absolutely the balance right because one of the things that I wanted to make sure is that we have a policy that doesn’t leave people behind, that supports industry, that supports jobs,” Albanese said.                  But Morrison said Labor’s target would increase electricity prices and cost jobs.                  “We’re on our way to net zero by 2050,” Morrison said. “We’re not on our way to drive people out of their jobs and force up their electricity price.”                        Morrison’s coalition was narrowly re-elected in 2019 when Labor promised to cut emissions by 45% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050.                  The government has also recently adopted the net zero target.                  Morrison was a Cabinet minister in 2014 when a newly elected government repealed Australia’s 2-year-old carbon tax. Government climate policies since have rejected any measures that would make polluters pay for their emissions.     "

The secret staircase room was described by Saugerties police as ""dark and wet."" Police had previously visited the home multiple times in their search for the now-six-year-old, as they have long suspected Paislee's non-custodial biological mother and father, Kim Cooper and Kirk Shultis, had kidnapped the girl, according to CBS2. Saugerties Police Chief Joseph Sinagra, speaking to WNYT, said they had been to that location ""a number of times."" But a new tip came in, leading police to obtain a search warrant for the residence, according to a Saugerties Police Department press release. Officials had been searching the home for ""a little over an hour"" before one cop made the staircase discovery. “He took a flashlight and looked between the cracks between the steps,"" Sinagra told CBS2.  ""He saw what he thought it was a blanket, and at that point they used a halogen tool, a forcible entry tool, and they started ripping the steps off the staircase, itself. At one point they saw little feet, as he put it."" Latest Cooper was found hiding with Paislee in the enclosure. Sinagra said it is believed Paislee had been in the Saugerties home for the duration of her disappearance. ""The child did not appear to be abused,"" Sinagra said.  Though it was noted that she could not read nor write, and had not been provided any education within the home, Paislee was found in good health otherwise. MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE Paislee had last been seen in July 2019 at the home of her legal guardians. It is believed that Cooper and Shultis took the girl from that location and have been hiding her since. Kim Cooper and Kirk Shultis did not have custody of Paislee, which Sinagra notes they lost at some point in 2019. ""There was a reason why they lost custody of the children,"" Sinagra said, adding that Paislee's older sister has been with her legal guardian since 2019. Cooper has been charged with custodial interference in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child. She was also wanted on an active warrant, according to the Daily Freeman. Shultis has been charged with felony custodial interference in the first degree and misdemeanor endangering the welfare of a child, as he has denied knowing the girl's location multiple times since her disappearance, according to the press release. Shultis' father and owner of the Saugerties home, Kirk Shultis Sr., was also charged with felony custodial interference in the first degree and misdemeanor endangering the welfare of a child, as it was revealed he lied to cops about his knowledge of where Paislee was. ""At the time of search warrant execution, the owner of the residence denied having any knowledge of the child's whereabouts telling officers that he had not seen the child since she was reported missing in 2019,"" the press release states. Sinagra did not disclose the location of Paislee's current location due to safety concerns, but said she has been placed with her legal guardian and reunited with her sister.

He attempted to connect with wide receiver Joshua Palmer on a second-and-nine play at his own 36-yard line. Cowboys’ safety Israel Mukuamu intercepted the pass at his own 37 and raced out of bounds to celebrate with his teammates on the sideline. Uh-oh.       Would it be one of those nights for one of two Chargers’ quarterbacks vying to become Justin Herbert’s backup when the regular season begins Sept. 11? Stick got the start Saturday after coming off the bench to replace Chase Daniel in the Chargers’ loss last Saturday to the Rams. As it turned out, it was merely one play in an eventful half for the Chargers and for Stick, who made amends with an 18-yard touchdown pass play to Palmer in the second half that gave the Chargers an all-too-brief 10-7 lead en route to a 29-10 deficit by halftime. It wasn’t just the giant overhanging scoreboard that went haywire. By halftime, Stick completed 11 of 20 passes for 134 yards. He also was the Chargers’ leading rusher with two carries for 24 yards, including a 25-yard scramble on the final play of the first quarter, keeping alive a scoring drive that resulted in his screen pass to Palmer for a TD. Daniel replaced Stick to start the third quarter, with the Chargers in a deep hole, a reverse of their assignments against the Rams. They’re expected to split the quarterbacking duties again next Friday in the Chargers’ exhibition finale against the New Orleans Saints.       “I think he has a huge role on this football team,” Chargers coach Brandon Staley said of Stick in the early days of training camp. “I thought he had a huge role last year. Easton is really improving as a player and I can’t say that enough. I’m really proud of his progress as a passer. “I think everyone knew that he could make plays. Everyone knew that he had a lot of intangibles, a lot of quarterbacking stuff that way. … He’s going to have a big role. He and Chase play a big role with Justin, and we feel like our quarterback environment is a big edge for our team.” Stick had mixed results in the first half Saturday, though he wasn’t responsible for all of the Chargers’ halftime deficit. On the plus side, Stick and Palmer linked up for three passes converting 75 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown and a 41-yard gain on a first-quarter play. However, Stick wasn’t as sharp as he needed to be and, in the closing seconds of the half, he had the ball stripped from him by Dallas’ Trysten Hill, who recovered the fumble at the Chargers’ 15. Four plays later, Malik Davis scored on a one-yard run and the Cowboys’ lead was 29-10. The Chargers’ special teams had given up a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and an 86-yard punt return for touchdowns by the Cowboys’ KaVontae Turpin, who was listed as the third returner on the Dallas depth chart. Mercifully, for Chargers fans, replays were unavailable because of a scoreboard outage. In addition, the Chargers gave up a two-yard TD run to Rico Dowdle, who carried 13 times for 44 yards in the first half. The scoreboard returned to life early in the third quarter, drawing a rousing ovation from the fans. Like the Chargers’ overall play, it wasn’t exactly flawless, with several large blocks malfunctioning at first before it finally returned to form midway through the third quarter.          "

Get a bouffant,The bouffant is back!,arkansasonline.com,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The bouffant is back! The hairstyle, known for its round shape, with hair swept off the face and shellacked into place with quite a bit of hair spray, is symbolic of all that is retro. Think of Catherine Deneuve, Betty Draper in Mad Men and multiple first ladies (Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Jacqueline Kennedy). But the bouffant has made some notable appearances in fashion in the past month or so. Bella Hadid had one at the Marc Jacobs show in February. She wore a fitted black dress and white gloves, and her hair, styled by Guido Palau, was reminiscent of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Kaia Gerber was given a similar hairstyle in a Loewe publication showcasing its spring 2020 womenswear, with hair sculpted into place by Simone Mason while posing in gowns on the grounds of the Isamu Noguchi Garden of Peace in Paris. For the February cover of Self Service magazine, blond model Rebecca Longendyke has hair styled by Duffy -- just one name -- with a few variations: wavy, messy, even short. The current CR Fashion Book with Kim Kardashian West, Naomi Campbell and Cher on alternate covers has the threesome posing as a biker gang in long brunette bouffants with bangs. ""The inspiration was the 1960s and Priscilla Presley,"" said Serena Radaelli, who did Cher's hair. ""Cher said, 'Excuse me, I was alive then,' and showed us photos of herself in the '60s. ""Big hair is fearless in a sense,"" Radaelli said. ""The modernity for this shoot was the length of the hair. It didn't actually take that long to do."" The unspoken message of the bouffant was always that it was high maintenance. ""They used to be this glaring symbol that you were a lady of the leisure class, right?"" said Stellene Volandes, editor-in-chief of Town & Country. ""They said, 'Yes, I have time to go to Kenneth and spend the afternoon there and have him tease my hair high and eat sandwiches from William Poll.'"" She was referring to hairdresser Kenneth Battelle, who was a master of the bouffant. Marilyn Monroe and Kennedy were clients. Volandes said she would send those curious about the bouffant to stylists who know their way around an uptown clientele: John Barrett, Valery Joseph, Julien Farel or Serge Normant -- or to Paul Podlucky's apartment salon on New York's East 67th Street for real Upper East Side verisimilitude. In short, it's rich lady hair, perfect for showing off jewelry. Hadid at Marc Jacobs was draped in diamonds. Or think of Kennedy at the state dinner for the Shah of Iran with a sunburst brooch from the London jeweler Wartski in her hair. Rachel Tashjian, 30, a style writer at GQ who occasionally wears her own platinum blond hair in a baby bouff, said that the bouffant looks back and forward. It's looking back at visual culture and trends of the 1960s and '70s and also taking note of bourgeois ideas around a lady of leisure. ""There is real emerging interest in the performance of getting dressed the way a woman without a job might have, the way dressing was described in Diana Vreeland's memoir,"" she said. Vreeland, an editor of Vogue in the 1960s, wore her jet-black hair pulled off her face into, yes, a bouffant, perhaps best to showcase her signature red blush. Yet what the bouffant also conveys is how we invest time on ourselves right now.

Most Republicans worry about how such a maneuver could imperil the U.S. economically. But many Republicans are also concerned about challenging the President and drawing his ire. So everyone was searching for a convenient escape hatch.  Buses would line up on the Capitol tarmac later Wednesday to escort senators to the airport so they could fly to France for ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Republican senators were more than happy that Congress made it a short week so lawmakers could flee to Europe and avoid questions by pesky scribes.  Many senators responded to reporters&apos; questions with vanilla bromides. Remarks like ""that&apos;s a hypothetical"" and ""we&apos;ll see"" pocked many conversations.  Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa faces what could be a competitive re-election race in a battleground state. President Trump won Iowa in 2016, but Democrats flipped two House seats there last year. The tariffs would be brutal for Iowa farmers, but Ernst didn’t directly answer when asked if she could oppose the president on the issue.  ""It&apos;s certainly harmful for Iowa,"" Ernst said as she headed for the Senate chamber.  ""I think there is reluctance to long-term, enforced tariffs,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, suggested that the tariff question ""won&apos;t be an issue,"" adding ""there will be some things to preclude that from happening.""  ""We&apos;re all hoping this [tariff] plan doesn&apos;t get executed,"" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. But Thune conceded that if Trump keeps his word, ""then it becomes real.""  ""There&apos;s a point where tariff fatigue sets in,"" said Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind. ""If it starts at five [percent], it will end up with 25 [percent] very quickly.""  Braun said implementing tariffs ""would put the USMCA [the proposed trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada] in peril.""  When asked by Jared Halpern of Fox News Radio if everyone was searching for an ""exit ramp,"" Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., conceded that ""exit ramp"" was the appropriate term to use when describing the conundrum.  Like Ernst, Perdue faces re-election in 2020 and Georgia is a state which could move into the ""swing"" column by then. The Peach State has shown some Democratic energy of late, and that could have consequences for Perdue&apos;s re-election effort. Still, the senator is standing foursquare behind Trump when it comes to tariffs.  ""He has to use a hammer,"" said Perdue when describing the President’s approach with Mexico. Perdue asserted he&apos;d even endorse 25 percent tariffs on America&apos;s southern neighbor because ""we&apos;re being invaded now.""  US and Mexico conduct high-level talks ahead of tariff deadline  The Mexican government dispatched Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard to the White House for a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan; Rich Edson reports from the White House.  But not every Republican feels that way. There are divisions among GOPers about how to pursue the tariff quandary. Back the President and you may be standing against the economic interests of your state. That’s why some congressional Republicans may try to engineer a vote to block or possibly rebuke President Trump if he imposes tariffs on Mexico.  Any action on such a measure will hinge on one thing: the math. Everything on Capitol Hill boils down to the math. And if Republicans don&apos;t think they can command a veto-proof supermajority to override a presidential veto, why would they want to get on record over such a controversial issue and risk drawing the ire of the president?  Lawmakers first want to see what Trump might do – as well as examine a possible executive order itself. Most Republicans don&apos;t want to be on the hook for something which may never see the light of day.  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., noted Wednesday that previous efforts to override presidential vetoes had fallen short.  ""We haven&apos;t been too successful in getting to a number that&apos;s even close to a veto-proof piece of legislation,"" he said.  President Trump may raise China tariffs after meeting with Chinese President Xi  Trump has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports and is considering tariffs on $300 billion more; State Department correspondent Rich Edson reports.  A successful veto override requires a two-thirds vote by both bodies: 67 in the 100-member Senate and 289 in the 433-member House (there are currently two North Carolina seats vacant). There have only been 111 successful veto overrides in U.S. history.  In March, the House failed to override Trump’s veto on a resolution to disapprove of his declaration of a national emergency for the southern border. The House voted 248-181 to override the veto but fell 38 votes short of the override threshold.  In May, the Senate voted 53-45 to override Trump&apos;s veto of a measure to bar the U.S. from helping Saudi Arabia-backed forces in Yemen&apos;s civil war. But with 98 senators casting ballots, the Senate needed 65 &apos;yea&apos; votes for an override.  Lawmakers from both sides would have to first study the executive order to understand exactly what it says.  Then, lawmakers would likely develop a ""resolution of disapproval."" Sources tell Fox the statute in play here is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The resolution would argue that Trump is abusing his powers when it comes to trade and his emergency declaration is out of alignment with IEEPA.  Adopting the resolution of disapproval requires a simple majority in the House and Senate. Such a resolution would most likely originate in the House.  Trump would then have to veto the resolution, the third veto of his presidency. The White House would then return the package to Capitol Hill for a prospective override attempt. The resolution would first go to the House, the body which originated the resolution of disapproval. If the House overrides the veto, the measure then goes to the Senate for its shot. If both chambers secure a 2/3 vote, the veto is overridden.  Where are the votes to block the president?  ""It&apos;s hard to know,"" Thune said Wednesday. ""We haven&apos;t whipped it.""  But all of this may be moot if the tariffs never go into effect. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has expressed doubt that Trump will actually impose the tariffs.  ""The President has a tendency for bluster,"" Schumer said. ""There are many examples of the President taking a maximalist position before eventually backing off.""  Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Erbrard visited the Capitol on Tuesday to talk with Grassley and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Ebrard noted that the Mexican Senate was already debating the USMCA.  Won&apos;t the tariff threat jeopardize passage of the USMCA?  ""We are going to have our best effort in order to avoid complications,"" said Erbrard at the Capitol.  When asked if he thought Trump was bluffing, Erbrard replied: ""Friday I can tell exactly what is going on.""  But if Trump isn&apos;t bluffing, there will be repercussions for lawmakers, who are struggling with their own political calculus.  House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson, D-Minn., captures the quintessence of this puzzle. Peterson is one of the most moderate Democrats in the House. He represents a conservative, rural district and won re-election to a 15th term in 2018 with 52 percent of the vote. However, President Trump carried Peterson’s district in 2016 by 30 points.  Peterson says the USMCA is ""dead in the water"" until issues are resolved with Mexico. Yet Peterson says farmers in his district ""are still with Trump.""  Why?  ""It&apos;s a good question,"" said Peterson, who noted that farmers back home already voted against the interests of their wallet. ""I can’t explain it. I think they just don&apos;t like Democrats that much.""  Yet, those voters seem to like Peterson.  ""Well,"" he said, ""I&apos;m not normal.""  This crystalizes the predicament facing lawmakers. Side with the president, even if it flies in the face of economic benefit to their district? Or oppose Trump out of fear of protecting their voters?  Most lawmakers didn&apos;t have to make that choice this week.  "

Anyone with unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, is being urged to immediately contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service.

We will work hard to redeploy as many employees as possible to other opportunities throughout the company.”  But sawmill closures and curtailments were happening in B.C. before the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the second half of 2019, 3,000 sawmill workers lost their jobs to sawmill closures and curtailments in B.C., due to a shrinkage in the annual allowable cut, high stumpage prices and falling demand and prices for lumber in the U.S.  In addition to permanently shutting down the Isle Pierre mill, Canfor's pulp division, Canfor Pulp Products Inc.

Ezzel-Deen al-Falih, a spokesman for the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR), said Prime Minister Abdallah al-Thani tendered the government's resignation to Speaker Aguila Saleh late on Sunday.  Parliamentary spokesman Abdallah Abaihig said HoR lawmakers would review the resignation of al-Thani's government, which is not internationally recognised, in their next meeting. No date has been set for the session.  Oil-rich Libya was plunged into chaos when a NATO-backed uprising in 2011 toppled longtime ruler Moammar Gaddafi, who was later killed. The country has since split between rival east- and west-based administrations, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.  A 14-month offensive by Haftar's forces to wrest control of the capital, Tripoli, from the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) crumbled in June, with the front lines now solidified near the central city of Sirte.    The HoR on Friday accused the Central Bank and the GNA of ""plundering"" the country and neglecting the east, in apparent efforts to deflect blame for the deterioration of public services.  In recent days, hundreds of people have taken to the streets of Benghazi and other eastern cities to protest against crippling electricity shortages and poor living conditions, setting tyres ablaze and blocking traffic on several major roads.  On Saturday, protests also erupted in al-Marj, a Haftar stronghold.  In a statement, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said at least one civilian had reportedly been killed and three others wounded in al-Marj. It called for ""a thorough and immediate"" investigation into ""the reported excessive use of force against peaceful demonstrations"" and the speedy release of a number of detained protesters.       The demonstrations in eastern Libya mirror similar protests in recent weeks over power cuts and corruption in Tripoli and other western cities.  UNSMIL said the protests across Libya were ""motivated by deep-seated frustrations about sustained poor living conditions, shortages of electricity and water, rampant corruption, misgovernance, and a lack of service provision throughout the country"".  The UN mission said the protests underscore ""the urgent need to lift the oil blockade"" and the return to a ""full and inclusive"" political process to end Libya's years-long conflict.  Powerful tribes in eastern Libya loyal to Haftar closed oil export terminals and choked off major pipelines at the start of the year to pressure the GNA.  The US Embassy in Libya said Haftar agreed to reopen oil fields and terminals no later than Saturday. By Sunday evening, it was not clear whether the blockade had been lifted.                            SOURCE:              Al Jazeera and news agencies            "

Government then abolished the multi-currency regime which was introduced in 2009 through Statutory Instrument 142 of 2019 in June this year.  In an interview this week, ZBCA president Francis Mangwendeza said the shifting of goalposts by government as a result of the currency changes has shortchanged them, hence the need for a class action suit against the state.  ""During the period prior to the abolition of the US dollar, contracts were denominated in US dollar. Treasury argues that contractors factored in parallel market rates into their pricing. That is true but only to a certain extent. Contracts priced in 2017 or earlier are more than likely to have been priced in US dollar than contracts priced in 2018,"" Mangwendeza said. ""Because of delays occasioned by various factors including non-payment of claims, lack of forex to import critical inputs and other technical factors, most contracts were lagging behind schedule. As such, a substantial number of contracts were priced before 2017.  Over and above this are issues to do with other contractual claims including retention. A two-year contract priced in 2015, commenced in 2016 and completed in 2017 now has retention due in 2018.""  He said they have taken legal opinion on this issue and have tried to engage the Ministry of Finance without success. This, he said, has resulted in their contemplating a class action as an industry to challenge ""the said directive and relevant Act"".  ""It is our view that the application of this particular directive from Treasury is ultra vires one of the principles upon which law is enforced: that you cannot apply the law in retrospect.. This statutory Instrument also contradicts the contract conditions which cannot be changed in retrospect.  What we mean is that where work has been undertaken and certified based on set of conditions and legal provisions, you cannot then apply a law in retrospect that changes those conditions upon which work was undertaken,"" Mangwendeza said. ""As such, it is our contention that all payments due for work done prior to the promulgation of the Treasury circular should be treated as intended in the contract. It is therefore only fair that work done and claims due prior to February be paid at the interbank rate.""  Mangwendeza said the banning of the multi-currency regime has been badly implemented and has crippled the construction sector.""The transition from foreign currency-denominated contracts to Zimdollar contracts has not been handled well enough and has threatened the viability of the industry.  The change has also caused economic instability. This makes it difficult for the industry to function,"" Mangwendeza pointed out. ""Construction has a long payment cycle from inception of a project to its final payment to recouping investments.  This necessitates a stable economy upon which certain predictions can be made. Where the predictions and or assumptions are adversely affected due to external factors, it brings uncertainty into the project.""He said the sector needs economic stability and predictability if it is to remain viable  ""The currency which is used is not critical as long as it is stable and exchangeable,"" Mangwendeza said.  He said the sector has been adversely affected by the prolonged power outages which last up to 18 hours on a daily basis.""Like all other sectors we have been adversely affected. We can no longer plan production schedules for those tasks and processes that require power.  Secondly, we are unable to get raw materials as we need them as suppliers' production, for example in cement and other products, is hampered by the lack of power,"" Mangwendeza said. ""The lack of power also lowers investor confidence which impacts on confidence and investment in the construction sector.""  "

Die Regierungschefs der Autoländer sprechen darüber. Volkswagen hat sich vor den Beratungen der Ministerpräsidenten von Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Württemberg über mögliche Auto-Kaufprämien in der Krise für eine weitreichende Förderung ausgesprochen.  Man werde sich dafür starkmachen, „dass die Politik Geld für diesen Impulsstoß bereitstellt“, erklärte VW-Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh am Mittwoch in einem Brief an die Mitarbeiter. „Wir wissen, dass wir damit nach Steuermitteln rufen“, heißt es in dem Schreiben, das der dpa vorliegt. „Aber wir wissen auch, dass sich dieses Geld für unsere gesamte Gesellschaft klug anlegen ließe und sich so gleich mehrfach rechnen könnte – nämlich ökonomisch, ökologisch und sozial.“ Generelle Kaufprämie oder Begrenzung auf E-Autos Die Regierungschefs der drei Autoländer – Stephan Weil (SPD), Markus Söder (CSU) und Winfried Kretschmann (Grüne) – wollen sich am Nachmittag zusammenschalten. Weil hatte am Montag zum Wiederanlauf des VW-Stammwerks Wolfsburg angekündigt, ein denkbares Prämienmodell zu prüfen: „Uns ist bewusst, dass wir eine schnelle Entscheidung brauchen.“ VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess forderte „baldige kraftvolle Maßnahmen“. Söder sagte der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“: „Ich bin für eine sehr umfassende Strategie, wie wir der Automobilindustrie helfen.“ Nach den Vorstellungen des VW-Betriebsrats sollte ein Fördermodell unter anderem eine „Impuls-Prämie“ für Neuwagenkäufe inklusive Leasing umfassen, die auch für moderne Verbrenner gilt und über „einen klar begrenzten Zeitraum“ läuft. Sie sollte ähnlich hoch sein wie die „Abwrackprämie“ in der Finanzkrise 2009 und sich auch auf junge Gebrauchtwagen bis zum Alter von einem Jahr erstrecken. Abwrackprämie zusätzlich Zudem möchte Osterloh eine „zusätzliche Abwrackprämie obendrauf“, die es für verschrottete Altautos der Abgasnormen Euro-3 und Euro-4 gibt. Die deutschen Hersteller sollten sich nach Meinung von VW einig sein, die staatlichen Mittel „je nach zugesagter Summe womöglich sogar zu verdoppeln, zumindest aber die Wechselkosten zu übernehmen“. Daneben solle der CO2-Ausstoß als Bemessungsgrundlage für die Kfz-Steuer stärker berücksichtigt werden.  Söder hatte in der vergangenen Woche erklärt, er wolle sich mit seinen beiden Kollegen aus Hannover und Stuttgart zusammensetzen, um etwa über ökologische Prämienmodelle nachzudenken und gerade der neuen Generation von Motoren und Autos nach der Phase des Durchhaltens eine Möglichkeit zu geben. Die Autobauer hatten wegen des Nachfrageeinbruchs und unterbrochener Lieferketten ihre Werke über mehrere Wochen schließen müssen – drastische Umsatzrückgänge sind die Folge. Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze (SPD) befürwortet neue Hilfen für die Autoindustrie, wenn sich die Förderung „auf klimaschonende Fahrzeuge“ konzentriert. (dpa)   Eine Buchempfehlung vom Verlag der Epoch Times Wenn der Staat eine aktive Rolle in der Wirtschaft spielt, hat jede Aktion einen Dominoeffekt auf den Markt. Neue Richtlinien und Gesetze können ganze Branchen verändern und viele Unternehmen und Investoren von den Entscheidungen der Regierung abhängig machen. Der Staat, der traditionell nur Gesetze verabschiedete und durchsetzte, ist dadurch ein führender Akteur in der Wirtschaft geworden.  Der Staat ist wie ein Schiedsrichter, der bei einem Fußballspiel auch noch zum Spieler wird: Er kontrolliert und reguliert das Kapital in einer Wirtschaft, die früher privat war und ersetzt damit die „unsichtbare Hand“ durch die „sichtbare Hand“. Es gibt mindestens zwei Hauptfolgen der umfangreichen staatlichen Eingriffe. Erstens erweitert sich die Macht des Staates hinsichtlich seiner Rolle und seines Umfangs. Regierungsbeamte entwickeln zunehmend Überheblichkeit hinsichtlich ihrer Fähigkeit, in die Wirtschaft einzugreifen und den Staat die Rolle des Retters spielen zu lassen. Auch nach der Bewältigung einer Krise behält die Regierung für gewöhnlich ihre erweiterten Befugnisse und Funktionen bei – wie im Kapitel 9 des Buches „Wie der Teufel die Welt beherrscht“ analysiert wird.  Zweitens führt der Interventionismus zu mehr Abhängigkeit von der Regierung. Wenn die Menschen auf Herausforderungen stoßen oder wenn der freie Markt nicht die Vorteile bieten kann, die sie sich wünschen, werden sie sich für mehr staatliche Eingriffe einsetzen, um ihre Forderungen erfüllt zu bekommen. Hier weitere Informationen und Leseproben.

The leaders said not all proposals made by regional leaders will be included in the final BBI report.  They said that Dr Ruto has no moral authority to stop the rallies on the basis of sentiments that would not influence the final report.  Cherangany MP Joshua Kutuny claimed the DP has always been against the BBI.  ""If he [Dr Ruto] wants to oppose BBI, he has an option of saying yes or no. We are not forcing anyone to subscribe to our school of thought. Only Uhuru and Raila can stop the drive,"" said Mr Kutuny.  He said that not all what leaders say will be included in the final BBI report.  ""The only way they can stop the reggae is to oppose it. They can oppose the reggae and give us blues or RNB or even Lingala. He (Ruto) can come up with another vibe,"" Mr Kutuny said, adding that the DP's sentiments were ""desperate"" attempts by the anti-BBI brigade to stop the drive.  STOP RALLIES  Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and Nyeri Town MP Wambugu Ngunjiri said the DP cannot stop the rallies ""because he did not start them.""  ""He has no capacity. He has more pressing issues to deal with before he drags himself into the BBI conversation. Let him clear his name in the multiple corruption cases he has been implicated in,"" said Mr Malala.  Mr Ngunjiri noted that the Deputy President cannot stop the BBI rallies because he did not start them.  Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said the problem with Dr Ruto and his allies is that their BBI catch-up strategy is not working.  ""The BBI train has left the station but they are struggling to hang on a fast moving BBI train. All their dirty schemes against BBI have crumbled. They tried to sneak the BBI report to Parliament, it didn't work. They tried to conduct parallel rallies, it never worked. They tried to introduce Luhya supremacy narrative ahead of Kakamega rally, it never worked,"" said Mr Osotsi.  He added: ""They then tried to hijack BBI rally in Kitui, it never worked. They tried to cause unnecessary drama in Narok by raising petty issues on language translation issues, it did not work. They are panicking and facing a political catastrophe as evidenced by numerous leaders who are exiting their camp to join BBI train.""  The ANC nominated MP said Dr Ruto should be bold enough to oppose BBI instead of sending mixed signals that are contradicting his boss President Kenyatta.  HANDSHAKE  ""They can't also purport to support BBI while at the same time belittling the handshake. The handshake and BBI are intertwined. Incessant attacks on Raila are a direct attack on Uhuru and his government,"" added Mr Osotsi.  MPs Chris Omulele (Luanda), Florence Mutua (Busia County) and Elisha Odhiambo (Gem) said the BBI train had taken off and only the two principals -- President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga -- with the support of Kenyans can stop it.  ""The Deputy President should wake up and smell the coffee. BBI is bigger than him. It is a national re-evaluation of our ethics, cohesion and aspirations,"" Mr Omulele said.  He added: ""It was mooted by the President and Mr Odinga on behalf of Kenyans and the DP does not need to be reminded of this.""  ""If the DP imagines that the BBI is about him and his personal ambitions, he has missed the train by a mile. He will, therefore, not be available to dance to music he can't hear or understand because he will simply have failed to attend the party,"" added Mr Omulele.  Ms Mutua said that ""in as much as I personally don't support any tribal whipping and incitement, it is also wrong to use what one leader said to try and blame it on BBI.""  ""No one will stop reggae and the DP and his supporters should come to the BBI meetings and air their views too,"" Ms Mutua said.  THREATS  Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo cautioned Dr Ruto against issuing threats over the BBI drive.  ""Let him stop his threats and pettiness. No one can stop a mass movement,"" said Mr Odhiambo.  On Sunday, Dr Ruto told leaders, whom he did not name, that Kenya is a God-fearing nation and that a few self-centred people will not be allowed to plunge it into political turmoil.  ""When the leaders spoke at Narok's BBI rally, they spoke of dividing Kenyans. As the government, this is not what we want.""  He stressed that the BBI is meant to unite Kenyans, not divide them.  After violence was witnessed at the BBI rally in Kitui County, DP Ruto noted that this is not the way to approach the debate.  He said bridges cannot be built with violence and that each person has a right to be heard as the BBI matter concerns all Kenyans.  "

Ajayi succeeds fellow co-founder Iyah Romm, who stepped down to focus on his mental health. The appointment marks a new chapter for the Brooklyn-based startup, which has raised almost $900 million since its formation in 2017 to serve publicly-insured, low-income patients. Cityblock now boasts more than 1,000 employees and is reportedly valued at nearly $6 billion. Ajayi faces the challenge of scaling a business that is focused on personalized, community-centered care—and, in doing so, proving whether scale and personalization are compatible. Cityblock operates in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and will expand into Ohio later this year, with more markets to come. What does personalized care mean to you? It means meeting people where they are and understanding that health care and health outcomes are not just a function of your diagnoses, lab tests or one organ system or the other. Understanding someone's mental health and social health and wellbeing is just as important, if not more important, than their physical health and wellbeing. You may have diabetes or high blood pressure or an autoimmune disease. There's research about what specific intervention medically we could use for each person, [but] what matters the most is that we understand how this is contextualized in your life. If you're hungry every day, if you don't have enough money to put food on the table, if you're super lonesome and struggling to feel connected — that matters just as much as the specific diagnoses that you have. We would be doing you a disservice by giving you exactly the same treatment plan as we give somebody who wasn't hungry or who wasn't lonely. We're recognizing the specific dimensions of each individual we serve. What is one question health care providers should be asking their patients? Can I have two? I've long believed that the answers to these two questions are actually really predictive of a person's overall needs and their outcomes. The first question is, ""Is there a single human being in the health care system that you know, and trust deeply, who would recognize you — and you would recognize them by name — if you saw them out of context? The other question I ask is, ""Is there a person in your personal life who you know deeply and trust, who you would entrust decision making to if you're unable to make decisions for yourself?"" When we discharge people from the hospital, many people run into trouble. That's why our readmission rates are so high. They can't remember what their medication list was. They were supposed to be taking insulin three times a day, but they don't have enough food to take with their medication. Who are they going to call? A big part of why Cityblock is so special is that we fill that gap. How do you build trust among patients who lost faith in the health care system or never had any to begin with? First of all, you show up with humility, and you show up recognizing that you have to earn that trust, that it's not going to be given to you. We ask questions, state our intent. You ask them for permission to learn more about what's going on. You show up and act like you care. You treat people with respect and with dignity, like you want to be treated or would want your loved one to be treated. You do what you say you're going to do. When you say you're going to show up, you show up. Folks who have lived experience, who come from the communities that we're serving, are often much better positioned to earn trust than a doctor in a white coat hammering on about clinical things. Showing up with a persona and orientation that's aligned around the member and their needs, wants and desires is really important. The other thing is being respectful but tenacious. You don't give up on people. We show up consistently, respectfully, tenaciously and continue to earn that relationship. New York's Medicaid program could see a lot of changes with the next budget. What do you think state lawmakers should do or not do? The core tenets that we continue to push for remain the same: integration of physical and behavioral health services on the Medicaid side and for people who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We push for a policy that expands and safeguards access to substance use treatment. We have benefited so much from partnerships with community-based providers, and this is where the opportunity is to augment the funding that community providers receive The evidence shows us over and over again that we can keep people out of the hospital if we provide them with person-centered, high quality, proactive, community-based care — if we strengthen the safety nets provided in the community around health and social services. —Maya Kaufman   Hackensack Meridian, Englewood merger dealt major blow in appeals court Hackensack Meridian Health's plan to acquire rival Englewood Health is all but dead after a federal appeals court indicated that it would run afoul of antitrust laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Tuesday upheld a decision to temporarily block the merger, after the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint alleging the deal was unlawful. The panel of three judges agreed that the deal likely would lessen competition in the New Jersey hospital market and drive up health care prices. Federal law prohibits mergers that might substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly. ""In recent years, Hackensack has acquired other health providers, each time raising prices at the acquired facility,"" the judges wrote in their decision, adding, ""Past behavior is often indicative of future behavior."" The New Jersey health systems signed the merger agreement in 2019. Hackensack Meridian—which, with 16 hospitals in its network, is the state's largest health system—pledged $439.5 million in capital investments over eight years as part of the deal. Representatives from both systems argued the merger would offer such benefits as upgrades and increased capacity limits at Englewood Hospital and the expansion of complex tertiary and quaternary care at Hackensack University Medical Center. Englewood Health operates a community hospital in Bergen County, where Hackensack runs two hospitals as well as a physician network and health foundation. The appeals court Tuesday countered that the ""claimed benefits were speculative or non-merger-specific"" and did not outweigh the merger's expected impact on prices. An expert for the FTC projected the hospitals would be able to increase prices by $31 million after the merger. ""Although this is not the decision we had hoped for, we entered merger planning from a position of strength,"" Englewood Health said in a statement. ""Englewood Health will continue to move forward with our strategic plan, enhancing our services and improving access for patients and communities across northern New Jersey."" Hackensack Meridian said it is weighing next steps. ""We firmly believe this merger is in the best interest of our patients and the community at large,"" the system said in a statement. The FTC's complaint against the proposed merger is slated for an administrative trial in 30 days. —M.K.   Midtown opioid nonprofit doles out $11M in grants The Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts on Tuesday announced the distribution of nearly $11 million in grants to nine organizations and universities across the country specializing in prevention, treatment, intervention and recovery. The Midtown-based, grant-making nonprofit funds organizations with resources to address the opioid crisis. During the past two years, FORE has awarded 64 grants totaling nearly $30 million for projects aimed at combating opioid use. Its latest $10.9 million outlay is the second largest since FORE was established in October 2018 and one that occurred after a lengthy request-for-proposal process. ""We received 400 applications from organizations across the country,"" said Dr. Karen Scott, FORE president. ""We're very excited about the nine we selected and announced today."" Many of the projects funded by the new grants target the adverse effect of opioid use on families and focus on treatment for children exposed to opioid use by their parents or caregivers. A $1.5 million grant to the Morgan County Partnership in West Virginia funds a community initiative to support children impacted by the opioid use of family members. A $439,547 grant to the Georgia Institute of Technology funds an investigation into the behavior outcomes of children exposed to parental opioid use. ""We don't want to create more silos with this work. We want to make it accessible and reach as many children and families as possible,"" Scott said. ""We look for how these interventions can be woven into places where children and families are right now."" A $1.48 million grant to the Denver Health and Hospital Foundation is designed to team with doctors and investigators to integrate an adult opioid treatment model—one already developed across the city's health care network—into a system for children and families. ""It will be working pediatric services into a comprehensive network of treatment that becomes family-based, rather than focused around the individuals,"" Scott said. FORE's grants are funded by the McKesson Corp., which donated them as a one-time gift to find opioid solutions. From 1999 to 2019 more than 500,000 Americans died from an overdose involving an opioid, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. —Brian Pascus   Pfizer to supply UNICEF with enough Covid treatment for 4 million people Pfizer will sell UNICEF up to 4 million treatment courses of its Covid-19 pill for distribution in 95 low- and middle-income countries, it announced Tuesday. The Midtown East drugmaker did not disclose financial terms of the deal but said it will supply the countries with Paxlovid doses at a not-for-profit price, pending local authorization or approval. Upper-middle-income countries included in the UNICEF deal will be subject to Pfizer's tiered pricing for the Covid treatment, the company said. The drugmaker previously agreed to sell 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid to the U.S. government for about $529 each. Pfizer did not name the 95 countries but said the list includes all low- and lower-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Supplying to UNICEF is an important part of our comprehensive strategy to accelerate access to Paxlovid to treat Covid-19 infection as quickly as possible and at an affordable price in order to decrease the strain on health care systems and help save lives in low- and middle-income countries,"" Chairmand and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. Paxlovid is administered as three tablets taken orally twice daily for five days. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December granted it an emergency-use authorization to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 in patients who are 12 or older and at high risk of developing severe symptoms. Between then and the end of the year, the treatment generated $76 million in U.S. sales for Pfizer. The company is now forecasting record revenue for this year. —M.K.

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved. They must also not promote any commercial business, involve any person or organization that promotes hatred of any person or class of persons or otherwise involves illegal activity or contain any “inflammatory, obscene or libellous statement.”  In an emailed statement Monday, the city said the intent of  proclamations is to “celebrate and recognize organizations and events that are meaningful to our community and its residents.” Part of the evaluation process considers if the organization requesting the proclamation is local or has a provincial chapter, it continued.  A two-page city document that can be found online  regarding proclamation requests and the associated bylaw states the event being proclaimed must be relevant to Regina or Saskatchewan. The city was unable to provide any documentation that outlines criteria in further detail as of press time.  "

यूएपीए: ‘खौफनाक कानून' के इस्तेमाल में टॉप पर है प्रदेश, योगी और भाजपा को लग सकता है तगड़ा झटका ",No description,amarujala.com," देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।   जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।  मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।  वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है। उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।  यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई बेहद सख्त प्रावधान किए गए हैं। इस कानून के तहत केस में अग्रिम जमानत नहीं मिल सकती। किसी भी भारतीय या विदेशी के खिलाफ इस कानून के तहत केस चल सकता है। अपराध कहां पर हुआ है, इससे कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता। विदेशी धरती पर अपराध किए जाने के मामले में भी इसके तहत मुकदमा दर्ज हो सकता है। यह कानून एनआईए को अधिकार देता है कि वह किसी तरह की आतंकी गतिविधि में शामिल संदिग्ध को आतंकी घोषित कर सकती है। पहले यह व्यवस्था थी कि आतंकवाद के किसी भी मामले में संपत्ति अटैच करने की कार्यवाही जांच अधिकारी बिना डीजीपी की अनुमति लिए नहीं कर सकता था। अब एनआईए का जांच अफसर सिर्फ एनआईए के डीजी की इजाजत लेकर कार्रवाई कर सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।    विस्तार   देश में 'खौफनाक कानून' कहे जाने वाले 'गैर-कानूनी गतिविधियां (रोकथाम) अधिनियम' यानी यूएपीए का उत्तर प्रदेश में जमकर इस्तेमाल हो रहा है। हालांकि विपक्षी दल 'इस्तेमाल' की जगह 'दुरुपयोग' शब्द का प्रयोग करते हैं। मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ के सत्ता संभालने के बाद तो एकाएक इस कानून के तहत दर्ज होने वाले मामलों में तेजी आ गई। नए और पुराने केसों की गति में सत्तर फीसदी से ज्यादा का अंतर हो गया।      जम्मू कश्मीर और उत्तर पूर्व के राज्य भी उत्तर प्रदेश से पीछे छूट गए। साल 2017 में यूएपीए के तहत यूपी में 109 मामले दर्ज हुए थे, जिनमें 382 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। अगले साल यानी 2018 में 107 केसों में 479 लोग और 2019 में दर्ज हुए 81 मामलों में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। विपक्षी दलों का कहना है कि मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ और भाजपा, दोनों को इस कानून का दुरुपयोग अगले साल होने वाले विधानसभा चुनावों में तगड़ा झटका दे सकता है।           मामले कम व गिरफ्तारी ज्यादा, इस ट्रेंड में यूपी अव्वल है यूएपीए के तहत दर्ज मामले की जांच, राज्य पुलिस और राष्ट्रीय जांच एजेंसी (एनआईए) द्वारा की जाती है। जहां तक एनआईए का संबंध है, आतंकवाद से जुड़े मामलों के त्वरित विचारण यानी ट्रायल के लिए अब पूरे देश में अब तक 48 विशेष अदालतों का गठन किया गया है। अगर यूपी की ही बात करें तो 2015 में महज छह केस दर्ज किए गए थे। इनमें 23 व्यक्ति गिरफ्तार हुए। इससे अगले साल यानी 2016 में 10 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 15 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। साल 2017 में 109 केस दर्ज हुए, जिनमें 382 लोगों को पकड़ कर जेल में डाल दिया गया।   इसके अगले वर्ष यानी 2018 में 479 और 2019 में 498 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। यूपी में चार वर्षों के दौरान यूएपीए के 313 केस दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 1397 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया। असम में 2015 के दौरान 103 केस में 128 गिरफ्तारी, 2016 में 216 मामलों में 219 गिरफ्तार, 2017 में 133 केसों में 374 गिरफ्तार, 2018 के 308 केसों में 170 गिरफ्तार और 2019 में 87 केसों के तहत 112 लोग गिरफ्तार किए गए। जम्मू कश्मीर में यूएपीए के अंतर्गत 2015 से लेकर 2019 तक 876 केस दर्ज हुए थे। इनमें 505 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई।   झारखंड में यूएपीए के तहत चार वर्षों के दौरान 415 केसों में 516 लोगों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। तमिलनाडु में चार वर्ष में 278 केस दर्ज थे। इनमें 328 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई। मणिपुर में इस अवधि के दौरान यूएपीए के तहत 1796 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 2158 लोगों को पकड़कर जेल में डाल दिया गया। केरल में 145 मामले दर्ज हुए हैं। इनमें 85 लोगों की गिरफ्तारी हुई है। इसी तरह बिहार में चार वर्ष के दौरान 203 केस दर्ज किए गए, जिनमें 567 लोगों को गिरफ्तार किया गया।      5922 में से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हुआ    वर्ष 2019 की एनसीआरबी रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, यूएपीए के तहत एक साल में गिरफ्तार किए गए व्यक्तियों की कुल संख्या 1948 है। इस कानून के अंतर्गत साल 2016 से लेकर 2019 तक 5922 गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। खास बात है कि इनमें से केवल 132 व्यक्तियों पर दोष साबित हो सका। इससे पता चलता है कि यूएपीए का दुरुपयोग हो रहा है। यूपी के पूर्व पुलिस महानिदेशक (डीजीपी), विक्रम सिंह ने इस मामले में कहा है कि यूएपीए एक बहुत ही संवेदनशील कानून है। इसे बहुत ही सावधानी के साथ लागू किया जाना चाहिए। इस कानून का किसी भी तरह का दुरुपयोग, बहुत गंभीर परिणाम दे सकता है। कानून का दुरुपयोग इसकी पवित्रता को कम करने के लिए काफी है। इस कानून के तहत सैकड़ों लोगों को गिरफ्तार करने के लिए एक अनिवार्य कारण होना चाहिए। पूर्व आईपीएस वीएन सिंह भी कह चुके हैं कि ऐसे कठोर कानून का नियमित आधार पर इस्तेमाल ठीक नहीं है। इससे दुरुपयोग की संभावना बनी रहती है। यूएपीए का इस्तेमाल बहुत ही दुर्लभ मामलों में किया जाना चाहिए। यूपी में इसके नियमित इस्तेमाल से कानून व्यवस्था में कोई सुधार नहीं हुआ है। बेगुनाह लोगों पर यूएपीए लगाना गलत है।    कई हस्तियों को यूएपीए के तहत जेल में डाला गया है    उमर खालिद सहित कई एक्टिविस्ट और सामाजिक हस्तियां इस एक्ट के तहत जेल जा चुकी हैं। मानव अधिकार कार्यकर्ता डॉक्टर बिनायक सेन, दलित अधिकारों के लिए काम करने वाले सुधीर धवाले, आदिवासियों की भलाई में जुटे महेश राउत और मशहूर कवि वरवर राव को यूएपीए के तहत गिरफ्तार किए गए थे। इतना ही नहीं, आदिवासी अधिकारों के लिए आवाज उठाने वाली सुधा भारद्वाज व रिसर्च स्कॉलर रोना विल्सन पर भी केस दर्ज किया गया। यूपी कांग्रेस के अध्यक्ष अजय लल्लू बताते हैं, मुख्यमंत्री योगी आदित्यनाथ इस कानून का दुरुपयोग कर रहे हैं। राजनीतिक खुन्नस निकालने के लिए इसी खौफनाक कानून का सहारा लिया जा रहा है। अगले चुनाव में यूपी की जनता भाजपा और योगी, दोनों को सबक सिखाने के लिए तैयार बैठी है। यूपी में मामले कम दर्ज होते हैं, लेकिन उनमें सैकड़ों बेकसूर लोगों को जेलों में डाल दिया जाता है। यूएपीए का जमकर दुरुपयोग हो रहा है।     2019 में हुए संशोधन से यूएपीए कानून 'कठोर' बन गया है    यह कानून 1967 में लाया गया था। 2019 में इसमें कई संशोधन कर दिए गए। अब संस्थाओं को ही नहीं, बल्कि व्यक्तियों को भी आतंकवादी घोषित किया जा सकता है।इसके लिए उस व्यक्ति का किसी आतंकी संगठन से संबंध दिखाना भी जरूरी नहीं है। यूएपीए के तहत देश और देश के बाहर गैरकानूनी गतिविधियों को रोकने के मकसद से कई

सकता है। इस कानून में सात साल तक की कैद का प्रावधान है। गैर कानूनी या आतंकी गतिविधि में किसी की जान जाती है तो आरोपी की सजा उम्र कैद या मृत्युदंड भी हो सकती है।              "

Big late save to deny Toney. 7 John Stones Didn't make much use of the possession he had and was troubled defensively, by Henry down Brentford's left and from long balls. 5 Manuel Akanji Outjumped by Ben Mee in the lead-up to Brentford's goal and given a tough time by the excellent Ivan Toney. 5  READ MORE: City vs Brentford as it happened  Aymeric Laporte Wasn't great for Toney's goal, but played better after having his head strapped and made one brilliant clearance in the second half when a goal looked certain. 7 Joao Cancelo Lacked his usual playmaking quality from left back. Link with Foden wasn't as natural as it's been with others. Booked for diving late on. 5 Rodri Told off by Guardiola for one backwards pass than put Akanji under pressure and was never at his best. 6 Ilkay Gundogan Couple of loose passes and heavy touches in the first half set the tone for City's struggles. Had to do better with a second-half chance and then let Toney in front of him for the dramatic late winner. 4 Kevin De Bruyne Had his fair share of injury disappointment during tournament football so hard to blame him for being cautious, but bar one spell in the first half he was fairly quiet. 6 Bernardo Silva Bright down the left and almost won a penalty with one fine flick past Henry. Nimble footwork kept Brentford on their toes. 7 Phil Foden Started like he was lacking rhythm, which was understandable after his recent lack of action, but took his goal quite brilliantly. 7 Erling Haaland Have to wonder how fit he was. Did his best to reach a couple of crosses that were just too heavy and did set Gundogan up for a golden chance, but didn't carry his usual threat. 6  Substitutes  Julian Alvarez Had one chance on the breakaway but delayed a decision too long and then passed the ball behind Haaland. 5   READ NEXT: "

""נוצרה מגמה ברורה של שינוי בצורך"", אומר שמחה גריידינגר, יו""ר ובעלי קבוצת נתיב. ""העובדה שאנשים ירצו לעבוד יותר מהבית הובילה את הרוכשים להוסיף כסף ולהתעקש על מרפסת גדולה, מחסן צמוד, פינת עבודה שתהפוך למשרד וכל מה שיאפשר שהות ללא הפרעות ובמרחב גדול"". גם השהות האינטנסיבית של כל בני המשפחה בבית במהלך הסגרים, בפרט בקרב משפחות מרובות ילדים, העצימה, לדבריו, את הקושי והאיצה את הרצון במרחב פתוח ובאוויר לנשימה: ""אנשים גם מעדיפים לעבור מהמרכז ליישובים מרוחקים יותר ולשכונות שיש בהן מרחב פתוח וריאות ירוקות. אנחנו רואים עלייה של 20%-15% במידת ההתעניינות ובפניות לדירות מגורים גדולות, במקביל למגמה ברורה של ירידה בביקוש לדירות קטנות של 3 חדרים"".    תזכורת: מחירי הדיור ממשיכים לעלות (צילום: משי בן עמי) המציאות החדשה מכתיבה שינוי גם בתכנון החלל עצמו. ""הבנו שאנו חייבים לגלות גמישות ודינמיות"", אומר גריידינגר. ""ערכנו שינויים והתאמות תכנוניות ואדריכליות תוך כדי תנועה. למשל, בפרויקט פסגת נתיב בשכונת רמת בית שמש ד'4 בבית שמש התוכניות האדריכליות עברו התאמות משמעותיות, ומתחם המגורים מציע כעת דירות גן ודירות עם חללים גדולים"". לדבריו, בדירות החדשות שהחברה מתכננת בשכונה בעיקר לציבור החרדי, יילקח בחשבון תכנון של מרפסות שמש בגדלים שונים. ""אנו צופים שהביקוש לעבודה מהבית רק יגבר, ולכן מתכננים מתחמים שיכללו אפשרות לפינות עבודה"".  ""דירות פנטהאוז ודירות גן תמיד היו מוצר נחשק בשוק הנדל""ן, אך רוכשים רבים ראו בקרבה לאזורי התעסוקה מרכיב לא פחות חשוב"", מוסיף גיל גורביץ', סמנכ""ל שיווק בחברת אזורים. לדבריו, הקורונה הובילה לשינוי סדרי עדיפויות: ""השינוי יימשך שכן לא מדובר בעוד אירוע שחלף ויישכח במהרה. כיום נוטים יותר לדירות מרווחות. דירות הפנטהאוז והגן הפכו למטרה עבור משפחות רבות, שמוכנות להקריב את המיקום ולהתרחק מעגל אחד רחוק יותר. כך גם לגבי בתים צמודי קרקע"".  גורביץ' מתייחס גם הוא לשינויים בעולם התעסוקה, כחלק מהשינויים בהרגלי הצריכה בתחום הנדל""ן. ""ביותר ויותר תחומים העבודה מרחוק הופכת למודל לגיטימי. בפרויקט הרצליה הילס שהקמנו עם עופר השקעות, למשל, התחלנו את תקופת הקורונה כשהבניינים בפרויקט מוכנים לאכלוס, אך נותרנו עם 10 דירות גן כי רוכשים לא הבינו למה הם צריכים גינות של 200-150 מ""ר ומרתפים גדולים ללא כניסה נפרדת שאינם יכולים להיות מושכרים כיחידת דיור. כשסדרי העדיפויות השתנו, הדירות האלו נראו מתאימות, אם בשל האפשרות להקים במרתף משרד לעבודה מהבית או משום שהחצר הפכה למרחב יקר ערך. בעקבות זאת מכרנו תוך 3 חודשים את כל הדירות"". חידוש נוסף הוא הקמת חללי עבודה משותפים ליד הבית. ""עובדים רבים הבינו שהם בכל זאת מעדיפים עבודה מהמשרד בזכות האינטראקציה החברתית. לטובת אלה יש חללי עבודה משותפים בסמיכות לבתי המגורים, ובהם אפשרויות לעבודה מרחוק במסגרת חברתית משותפת"", אומרת טלי כהן, סמנכ""לית שיווק בשפיר מגורים. ""השכונה השיתופית בצוותא בחריש, למשל, מציעה את תחושת הביחד שחסרה בשנה האחרונה"". מעדיפים דירות פנטהאוז כדי לקבל מרחב (צילומים: יריב כץ ועמית שעל)  נתוני הלמ""ס מצביעים, כאמור, על ירידה בהתחלות בנייה של דירות 6-5 חדרים בשנה החולפת. לדברי רז שרייבר, סמנכ""ל שיווק בקבוצת אלמוג, ""לנוכח צמצום ההיצע מחד, ועלייה בביקושים להגדלת מרחב המחייה כך שיתאים לרוח התקופה מאידך, האמירו משמעותית מחירי הדירות האלו. להערכתי, הירידה בכמות התחלות הבנייה של דירות גדולות תמשיך, בין היתר משום שקהלי יעד רבים אינם יכולים להרשות לעצמם דירות כאלה. כדי להנגיש אותן צמצמנו את מספר החדרים או המטראז' בכל סוגי הדירות, כדי לאפשר לאותם קהלים ליהנות ממוצר הכולל מרחב"". ""ביצענו שינוי תכנוני בתמהיל הדירות. בשלב ג' בפרויקט שאנחנו בונים בשוהם, למשל, נציע לראשונה דירות גן עם 4-3 חדרים ומיני פנטהאוזים ופנטהאוזים במטראז' נמוך יחסית לשלבי התכנון המוקדמים"", מוסיף שרייבר. ""לשם השוואה, בשלבי השיווק הראשונים שהחלו ב-2018 התכנון היה מיועד למשפחות של משפרי דיור, שכלל ברובו דירות רחבות ידיים - בנות 5 חדרים, עם גינה, פנטהאוזים וכאלה שנחשבות דירות פרמיום בהגדרה"". ""הבית הפך בשנה האחרונה למרכז חיינו ולמרחב שבתוכו אנחנו מעבירים את העבודה, הפנאי, המרגוע והחיים עצמם. הוא נהיה תחליף למלון, למסעדה, למשרד ולחיק הטבע. לכן כשמגיעים היום לרכוש דירה, סדרי העדיפות וההסתכלות על המבנה משמעותיים מאוד מבחינת הרוכשים"", מחזקת את הדברים עירית מעייני, מנהלת שיווק בחברת בית וגג. ""במקביל, ממשיכות עליות המחירים בשוק הדיור, והדירה הגדולה והמרווחת הולכת ומתרחקת, כך שהשאיפה לגור בדירות מיוחדות קשה לעיתים למימוש"". ""הבית הפך בשנה האחרונה למרכז חיינו ולמרחב שבתוכו אנחנו מעבירים את העבודה, הפנאי, המרגוע והחיים עצמם. הוא נהיה תחליף למלון, למסעדה, למשרד ולחיק הטבע"" לדבריה, נוצר צורך להכניס לסל המוצרים גם דירות המתאימות למצב השוק החדש. ""בפרויקטים שעדיין עומדים בשלב התכנון האדריכלי, שמנו השנה דגש על תכנון דירות רבות יותר בשטח קטן, אך המרחבים החיצוניים שלהן, גגות ומרפסות, יהיו מרווחים, בעיקר בקומות הגבוהות. למשל, במקום 2 פנטהאוזים בני 6-5 חדרים, תכננו 3 פנטהאוזים - אחד בן 4 חדרים ושניים בני 2.5-3 חדרים. פנטהאוז עם 3 חדרים ברובע 3 או 4 בתל אביב עם תג מחיר של כ-50 אלף שקל למ""ר הוא מוצר מבוקש"", היא מעריכה. לעומת זאת, לטענת רחלי בריזל, סמנכ""לית שיווק בחברת אשדר מקבוצת אשטרום, המגפה הביאה רוכשים שכבר היו בתהליך רכישה להתאמץ קצת יותר ולשדרג מ-4 חדרים ל-5 חדרים. לדבריה, ""בפרויקט שלנו בקריית אונו, למשל, היינו עדים לקצב מכירה מהיר של דירות 5 חדרים ודירות מיוחדות שבעבר היו נשארות לסוף השיווק והשנה נמכרו ראשונות. בפרויקט ברחוב טאגור בשכונת רמת אביב - אם בתחילת השיווק חשבנו שהדירות הקטנות יימכרו ראשונות בגלל המיקום, הרי שדווקא הדירות המיוחדות נמכרות קודם"".  ""משבר הקורונה הביא לשינויי תפיסה משמעותיים בכל הקשור למה שאנחנו קוראים לו בית"", מציין דן גינגס, סמנכ""ל שיווק באפריקה ישראל מגורים. לדבריו, אם בעבר בית היה המקום שבו בני המשפחה היו נרגעים אחרי יום עבודה, נחים ומארחים, הרי שבשנה האחרונה הוא הפך להיות גם המשרד, חדר הישיבות, בית הספר, המסעדה ומקום הבילוי. ""הדבר הכניס לשוק המגורים טרנדים חדשים, שעשויים להישאר איתנו עוד שנים קדימה"", הוא אומר. לדבריו, ""בשנה האחרונה חל ביקוש גובר להמיר אזורים מסוימים בדירה, פחות פרקטיים כביכול, לאזורים בעלי שימוש ייעודי כמו פינות עבודה וחדרי למידה. טרנד נוסף שהתחדד בעקבות השהייה הממושכת בבתים הוא הצורך בשטחים פתוחים: גברה ההעדפה לדירה עם מרפסת או גינה גדולה על חשבון שטח דירה מצומצם. נעשה סוג של Trade off בין שטחי הדירה הקלאסיים והמוכרים של פעם לשטחים חדשים בעלי שימושים ומאפיינים חדשים"".  לדברי נופר אלימלך, מעצבת בחברת סלע בינוי, ""בתקופת הקורונה הבית הפך למקום ששווה להשקיע בו, ואת החופשה המשפחתית שהתבטלה החליפו בשדרוגו. המרפסת הפכה למרחב משחרר גם בסגר ההדוק ביותר. בתחום עיצוב המרפסות נרשמה עלייה בבניית מטבחים לברביקיו ולאירוח וכן השקעה ניכרת בפינות רביצה. רבים ביקשו להתקין ג'קוזי או בריכת חוץ ומרחבים למשחקי ילדים"". לשיטתה של אורית נווה, מנהלת שיווק בקבוצת עץ השקד, ההחלטה על תמהיל וגודל הדירות בפרויקט מתקבלת בהתאם לשכונה ולקהל היעד. ""דירות גדולות באופן טבעי מתאימות למשפרי דיור ולמשפחות, לכן נכון לבנות אותן בשכונה שמתוכננת עבור הציבור הזה. למשל שכונת פארק הים בדרום בת ים צפויה לכלול כ-10,000 תושבים, לכן תוכננה באופן שנותן מענה לכל הצרכים, כמו שטחי ציבור, פארקים, מוסדות חינוך, שטחי מסחר, מתחם ספורט, בתי קפה וגישה נוחה לחוף הים. בפרויקט שאנחנו בונים בשכונה בשיתוף אמריקה ישראל, 80% מ-239 הדירות הן גדולות, בהתאם לקהל היעד"". הקורונה הכתיבה שינויים גם בתחום השיווק והמכירות. לדברי גורביץ', ""הבנו שהשמירה על הריחוק לצד הנחה במחירים יעשו עבודת מכירה מצוינת. במבצע שערכנו לאחרונה לעמיתי ארגון חבר בשכונת רמת הנשיא בבת ים, מכרנו קרוב ל-500 דירות על הנייר באונליין במסגרת של הגרלה. בזמן ההרשמה בדקנו אילו דגמים מבקשים הרוכשים לקנות. גילינו שבעוד הביקוש לדירות 4 חדרים עמד על 500%, הביקוש לדירות גדולות ומיוחדות הגיע לכ-8,000%. הביקושים לדירות גן ופנטהאוזים היו היסטריים, בתוך שעה מרגע המכירה לא נשארו עוד דירות כאלו""."

Now, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction  Israel's border fence with Syria, March 2019.  Gil Eliahu  Recent events on the Syrian border express what Military Intelligence has described over the past two months as the establishment of a new deterrent. Iran has decided to act against any attack it attributes to Israel, whether against Iran or organizations linked to it in the Middle East. At around 5 A.M., members of a Shi’ite militia fired four rockets from Syria into Israel in the northern Golan Heights; an Iron Dome battery intercepted all four and there were no injuries or damage.  skip - Haaretz Weekly Ep. 49  The rocket fire in September  was declared an Iranian response to an airstrike attributed to Israel against members of a Shi’ite militia in  near the Al-Bukamal border crossing with Syria. The airstrike happened at the end of August, after a day when airstrikes took place in Syria as well (near the Israeli border) and in Lebanon (in Dahiyeh, the Shi’ite neighborhood in south Beirut).  But in recent years, many attacks have been attributed to Israel and the Iranians responded in only a few cases. This time, according to intelligence, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction. So what was the explanation for the rockets before dawn Tuesday?  As of now, things aren’t completely clear; both Israel and Iran have remained silent. On Monday, the Israeli intelligence company ImageSat released satellite photos documenting what it calls the rapid construction of an Iranian base near the Al-Bukamal crossing.  There are also reports in the Arab media, of questionable credibility, of an incident at the beginning of the week in which a convoy of Shi’ite militias was struck in the desert in eastern Syria west of Deir Ezzor.  A photo released by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq after it launched an attack near the Syrian border, August 2019.  These incidents are happening against the backdrop of heightened preparedness by the Israeli military (which regularly moves Iron Dome batteries between southern and northern Israel), ongoing tension in  the Gaza Strip  (after the fighting with Islamic Jihad last week), intensive action by the Israel Air Force and a surprise drill declared Monday by the Northern Command. At the same time, Israel is in a political crisis as the time allotted to  Kahol Lavan chief Benny Gantz  to form a governing coalition draws to a close. This is a period when the dangers of mixing security and political considerations is higher than usual.  But apparently the most important regional development in recent days – and the competition is great – isn’t happening in Israel or Syria, but in Iran. Despite the regime’s harsh steps, above all cutting the country off from the Internet almost completely, the impression is that  the protests against the government  Reports by opposition activists and journalists coming indirectly to international media outlets reveal a major wave of violent demonstrations, organized attempts to use violence to suppress them, the deaths of dozens of protesters and a few members of the security forces, and methodical large-scale destruction of property. The real number of the injured or killed, like the exact scope of the demonstrations, is unclear.  Iranian-American journalist Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for The New York Times, tweeted on Monday night: “I’ve covered Iran for 25+ years. Never seen protests this brazen, this angry, this widespread. This is serious. That’s why there is a total Internet blackout. Regime is scared.” The protests in Iran broke out against the backdrop of the crises  in Iraq  and  Lebanon  , countries under strong Iranian influence.  In recent days, Arab newspapers have been covering their front pages with protests, incidents and mass-casualty disasters from Iran, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan. To some extent, these seem like a reincarnation of the Arab Spring, which was buried by the murderous civil wars that broke out in its wake. But this time, the main address for the protest in some of the countries is Iran, whose influence and power have grown, especially after the Assad regime's victory in Syria.  A gas station that was burned during protests following authorities' decision to raise gasoline prices, Tehran, November 17, 2019.  Abdolvahed Mirzazadeh / ISNA via AP  Ostensibly, recent developments in Iran should encourage Israel after a few months of the Iranians showing confidence and upping their provocations against the Gulf states and the United States. But officially, Jerusalem has been restrained in its public response. Perhaps more surprisingly, that has also been President Donald Trump’s response; in recent days he has been in no hurry to comment on Iran.  This is surprising because Trump has been harshly criticized, justifiably, for his inaction in the face of Iranian military operations. Now, when it seems that his sanctions policy is finally sparking a response in Iran, Trump is mired in political disputes at home.  Israeli defense officials have adamantly refused to predict what can be expected in Iran and are waiting for more information. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies,  has written on the think tank’s website  that right now there are no signs that the Iranian regime is in danger of collapse or is considering flexibility or giving in to Western demands regarding the nuclear agreement, despite the double pressure of protests and sanctions.  Zimmt is very cautious in his predictions; the regime in Tehran has been very effective in suppressing protests. But one lesson of the Arab Spring is the great difficulty in predicting the masses’ behavior during violent clashes and anticipating how protests will unfold.  Israel, by the way, didn’t have to wait for the Arab Spring to reach this conclusion. It learned this quite well during the first intifada, and to a lesser extent at the beginning of the second intifada.  "

She successfully ousted her father from the legal arrangement in September, and at a hearing on Friday a judge could end it altogether. Here’s a look at how conservatorships operate, what’s unusual about hers, and why she and so many fans have worked to #FreeBritney. HOW DO CONSERVATORSHIPS WORK? When a person is considered to have a severely diminished mental capacity, a court can step in and grant someone the power to make financial decisions and major life choices for them. California law says a conservatorship, called a guardianship in some states, is justified for a “person who is unable to provide properly for his or her personal needs for physical health, food, clothing, or shelter,” or for someone who is “substantially unable to manage his or her own financial resources or resist fraud or undue influence.” The conservator, as the appointee put in charge is called, may be a family member, a close friend or a court-appointed professional. Several states have recently used the attention that Spears has brought to the issue to reform their conservatorship laws. HOW DOES SPEARS’ WORK? With a fortune of more than $50 million comes secrecy, and the court closely guards the inner workings of Spears’ conservatorship. Some aspects have been revealed in documents. The conservatorship has the power to restrict her visitors. It arranges and oversees visits with her two teenage sons, whose father has full custody. It can take out restraining orders in her name, which it has used more than once to keep away interlopers deemed shady. It has the power to make her medical decisions and her business deals. She said at a June hearing that she has been compelled to take medication against her will, has been kept from having an intrauterine device for birth control removed and has been required to undertake performances when she didn’t want to. Spears also said she had been denied the right to get married or have another child, but she has since gotten engaged to longtime boyfriend Sam Asghari. WHO HAS POWER OVER SPEARS? The ultimate power in the conservatorship, and the sole power to end it, falls to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny. Before his suspension, her father James Spears had the lion’s share of day-to-day power over his daughter’s choices for 13 years. In 2019, he gave up the role of conservator over her life decisions, maintaining control only over her finances. He has now been now been replaced by John Zabel, an accountant chosen by Britney Spears and her attorney. Jodi Montgomery, a court-appointed professional, has acted as conservator over her personal matters since 2019. WHY HAVE SO MANY CALLED TO #FREEBRITNEY? Some fans have objected to the conservatorship since shortly after it began. But the movement, and the #FreeBritney hashtag, truly took hold early in 2019, when some believed she was being forced into a mental health hospital against her will. They pored over her social media posts to extract clues about her well-being, and coalesced into a movement that has arguably shifted public opinion. Hearings bring dozens of protesters to the courthouse, carrying signs like “CONSERVATORSHIP IS SLAVERY” and “THIS IS TOXIC.” Tearful fans have felt vindicated by two dramatic speeches she gave this summer, in which she confirmed many of their suspicions. And they felt triumphant when her father was removed. After that hearing, she thanked them in an Instagram post: “ #FreeBritney movement … I have no words … because of you guys and your constant resilience in freeing me from my conservatorship … my life is now in that direction !!!!!” WHY WAS IT IMPOSED IN THE FIRST PLACE? In 2007 and 2008, shortly after she became a mother, she began to have very public mental struggles, with media outlets obsessed over each moment. Hordes of paparazzi aggressively followed her every time she left her house, and she no longer seemed able to handle it. She attacked one cameraman’s car with an umbrella. She shaved her own head at a salon. She lost custody of her children. When she refused to turn over her boys after a visit, she was hospitalized and put on a psychiatric hold. The conservatorship was put in place within days. WHY HAS IT GONE ON SO LONG? A conservatorship can always be dissolved by the court. But it’s rare that a person achieves their own release from one, as Britney Spears appears on the verge of doing. They can last decades because the circumstances that lead to them, like traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s, or dementia, are not things people just bounce back from. The mandatory secrecy of medical records has kept murky the exact reasons why Britney Spears has remained in hers, but it’s clear that it involves psychiatric issues. Spears’ father and his attorneys justified the continued conservatorship by arguing that she was especially susceptible to people who seek to take advantage of her money and fame. HOW DOES SPEARS FEEL ABOUT ALL OF THIS? For years it was largely a mystery. But allowed to speak publicly in court in June, she called the conservatorship “abusive” and “stupid” and says it does her “way more harm than good.” WHAT HAPPENS IF THE JUDGE SAYS IT'S OVER? Regaining her personal and financial powers after so many years will take some untangling, and the process could take months. Montgomery, along with therapists and doctors, have created a care plan for the transition. The singer's attorney Mathew Rosengart has vowed to pursue an investigation of James' Spears handling of the conservatorship even after it ends. He could take action in civil court, and has suggested he may even turn over his findings to law enforcement for consideration of criminal charges. James Spears has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Britney Spears would likely hire financial managers, assistants and attorneys to perform many of the same duties previously performed by the conservatorship. But their decisions would be subject to her approval. And she could hire and fire them at will. ___ Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton                                                                                                                                                                                             "

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved.

Photo: Supplied / KiwiRail   Gisborne District Council is blaming human error for the railway being omitted from a shortlist it supplied to The Gisborne Herald this month of local infrastructure projects that are still in the running for taxpayer funds. Nationwide, more than 1900 projects were put forward for funding and 802 made the shortlist. The rail line was included in the council's funding application, but the council made it clear that while it supported reopening the track, it would not be in charge of the project. That responsibility would fall to KiwiRail, whose group chief executive Greg Miller said the line did not stack up economically. The council, in its application, said up to $23.3 million was needed to get the line open, but Miller believed it could cost up to five times as much. Despite this view, he was in Gisborne last week to meet with project stakeholders, including the council, and said there was more commercial support for the rail link than he realised. The line has been closed since 2012 due to storm damage. The shortlisted projects are being weighed up by Economic Development Minister Phil Twyford and Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones. Jones has previously said he will not overrule KiwiRail's view that it did not make sense to reopen the line. When asked this morning if that meant it was a forgone conclusion the rail project would not be funded, a spokesperson for Jones said he stood by his earlier comment. The five council projects that have made the shortlist are the redevelopment of Gisborne's Olympic Pool Complex and upgrades to the city's wastewater treatment plant, Waipaoa River stopbanks and residential wastewater and stormwater systems.

Ante la decisión de que no acompañen la evolución de los costos, es inevitable que el Estado termine subsidiando. La referencia de la última década, según un trabajo de Alejandro Einstoss y Julián Rojo, del Instituto Argentino de la Energía General Mosconi, permite prever lo que podría pasar de continuar la actual dinámica: el año pasado sumaron US$6700 millones y en el actual podrían llegar a US$10.000 millones.Los autores del documento estiman que, para cumplir con el presupuesto, la energía debería subir 40%, lo que tendría un impacto en factura final del 20% y permitiría una cobertura de subsidios con lo proyectado por el ministro Martín Guzmán.Enfatizan que el problema surge cuando se proyecta una posible evolución de los subsidios en base a los costos de generación y demanda estimados oficialmente sin nuevas subas de tarifas: para fines de este año los subsidios cubrirán el 70% del costo de generar energía, lo que demandará partidas presupuestarias adicionales no previstas en el presupuesto del orden de los $140.000 millones.En abril de 2011, las transferencias anualizadas alcanzaban los US$6600 millones; en un contexto de congelamiento tarifario de largo plazo y demandas políticas en un año electoral, llegaron a US$10.000 millones en diciembre de ese año. El pico fue en julio 2015, con US$17.000 millones ,,y abarcó la totalidad de la segunda presidencia de Cristina Kirchner. Juntos por el Cambio los redujo un 75% y en diciembre 2019 eran US$4700 millones.En el acumulado anual a abril último llegan a US$6700 millones, pero presionados por los consumos de invierno; el aumento de las importaciones tanto en volumen para cubrir el derrumbe de la producción local de gas natural del 11,4%, como por precios internacionales que duplican los de 2020, y, en particular, por el congelamiento de los precios de la energía.“De continuar la actual política de congelamiento sumergirá al sector y a la macroeconomía en una segunda ola de subsidios, pero esta vez con una economía sin superávits y escasas o nulas posibilidades de financiar subsidios de la magnitud del 2015 -agrega el documento-. El dispendio de subsidios descontrolados tuvo un costo superior a los US$100.000 millones (en la última década), que se financió devorando el superávit fiscal y el superávit comercial, que hundieron la macroeconomía en una estanflación hasta el momento indomable”."

The Sambadrome parade runway stands empty in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Monday, Sept. 21, 2020. Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, Sept. 24, said it has delayed its annual Carnival parade, saying the global spectacle cannot go ahead in February because of Brazil’s continued vulnerability to the new coronavirus pandemic. (AP Photo/Silvia Izquierdo) RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Rio de Janeiro throughout the coronavirus pandemic has been lifted, but gloom remains — the annual Carnival parade of flamboyant samba schools won’t be held in February. And while the decision is being characterized as a postponement of the event, no new date has been set.  Rio’s League of Samba Schools, LIESA, announced Thursday night that the spread of the coronavirus has made it impossible to safely hold the traditional parades that are a cultural mainstay and, for many, a source of livelihood. “Carnival is a party upon which many humble workers depend. The samba schools are community institutions, and the parades are just one detail of all that,” Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian who specializes in Rio’s Carnival, said in an interview. “An entire cultural and productive chain was disrupted by COVID.” Rio’s City Hall has yet to announce a decision about the Carnival street parties that also take place across the city. But its tourism promotion agency said in a statement to The Associated Press on Sept. 17 that without a coronavirus vaccine, it is uncertain when large public events can resume.  Brazil’s first confirmed coronavirus case was Feb. 26, one day after this year’s Carnival ended. As the number of infections grew, the samba schools that participate in the glitzy annual parade halted preparations for the 2021 event.  Nearly all of Rio’s samba schools are closely linked to working class communities. Their processions include elaborate floats accompanied by tireless drummers and costumed dancers who sing at the top of their lungs to impress a panel of judges. Tens of thousands of spectators pack the bleachers of the arena, known as the Sambadrome, while tens of millions watch on television. Before the schools began competing in the 1930s, Carnival was celebrated in dance halls and haphazardly on the streets, Simas said. The parades entered the Sambadrome in the 1980s, and have become Rio’s quintessential Carnival display. The immense labor required for each show was already stymied by restrictions on gatherings that Rio’s governor imposed in March. Even with those measures, Rio’s metropolitan region, home to 13 million people, so far has recorded more than 15,000 deaths from COVID-19.  Beneath the Sambadrome’s bleachers, the city created a homeless shelter for the vulnerable population during the pandemic. Samba schools suspended float construction, costume sewing, dance rehearsals, and also social projects. The Mangueira school’s program in the favela near downtown Rio that teaches music to children — keeping them away from crime, and cultivating the school’s future drummers — hasn’t held classes since March.  The pulse of entire suburban Rio cities like Nilopolis, whose population of 160,000 cheers the Beija-Flor samba school, has faded, Simas said. Some performers resorted to odd jobs and gigs. Diogo Jesús, the lead dancer referred to as “master of ceremonies” in the Mocidade school, couldn’t make rent without his income from private events. He started driving for Uber and sewing facemasks to sell at a fair.  “It was a blow. We live Carnival all year round, and many people when they realized everything would stop wound up getting sick or depressed,” Jesus said in an interview inside his house in Madureira, a neighborhood in northern Rio. “Carnival is our life.” The last year Rio’s Carnival was suspended was 1912, following the death of the foreign relations minister. The mayor of Rio, at the time Brazil’s capital, postponed by two months all licenses for the popular dance associations’ Carnival parties, according to Luís Cláudio Villafañe, a diplomat and author of the book “The Day They Delayed Carnival.” The mayor also voiced opposition to unregulated celebrations, but many Rio residents partied in the streets anyway. Revelers were undeterred during World War II. And they poured into the street every year during more than two decades of military dictatorship, until 1985, with government censors reviewing costumes, floats and song lyrics.  Then came coronavirus.  “We must await the coming months for definition about if there will be a vaccine or not, and when there will be immunization,” LIESA’s president, Jorge Castanheira, told reporters in Rio on Thursday. “We don’t have the safety conditions to set a date.” The 2020 coronavirus already forced Rio’s City Hall to scrap traditional plans for its second-biggest party, New Year’s Eve, which draws millions of people to Copacabana beach for dazzling fireworks. Earlier this month, the city’s tourism promotion agency Riotur announced that main tourist spots will instead display light and music shows to be broadcast over the internet. Delay of the Carnival parade will deprive Rio state of much needed tourism revenue. In 2020, Carnival drew 2.1 million visitors and generated 4 billion reais ($725 million) in economic activity, according to Riotur. A statement from the agency Thursday provided no further clarity on the fate of the Carnival street parties. Some parties are small — for example one including a few dozen dog owners exhibiting their pets wearing wigs or funny hats. But most feature amps blasting music to throngs of thousands who dance, kiss and swill booze in a crush of celebration. The biggest one boasts more than two million partygoers. Rita Fernandes, president of Os Blocos da Sebastiana, said her association already canceled its 11 street parties that together draw 1.5 million revelers. Most others groups will follow, she said. “We cannot be irresponsible and bring the multitudes to the street,” she said, pointing to Europe’s second wave of contagion. After several weeks of declining daily infections, Rio authorities have begun expressing concern about an uptick. Public spaces such as beaches have been crowded in violation of pandemic restrictions. A drummer in Mangueira’s samba school, Laudo Braz Neto, said the children he instructed before the pandemic are listless, and he knows there is no way to put on Carnival without being able to safely gather.  “Carnival will only really happen when the whole world can travel. It’s a spectacle the world watches, brings income and movement here,” he said. “I have no hope for 2021.” ____ Associated Press videojournalist Diarlei Rodrigues contributed to this report.   "

On three central issues, however, Trump gave out misinformation that had to be corrected later, spreading panic everywhere from European airports to the financial markets. It was the latest in a series of confusing, misleading or inaccurate statements from administration officials on a matter of life and death to people in the U.S. and around the world.  Trump said the U.S. would “be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,” but within hours statements from the White House and Department of Homeland Security clarified that it did not apply to legal permanent residents, or immediate family members of U.S. citizens. The fear of being stranded in Europe resulted in a  pre-dawn rush to airports  in tourist meccas such as Barcelona by American travelers trying to book flights home.  President Trump addressing the nation about the coronavirus on Wednesday. (Doug Mills/New York Times via AP, Pool)  Trump also said in his address that the restrictions would apply to “the tremendous amount of trade and cargo” across the Atlantic, but an hour later on Twitter he clarified that “the restriction stops people not goods.” The president also said that insurance companies were waiving copayments for testing and treatment related to coronavirus, but a hospital and insurance lobbying firm  It was not the first time inaccurate coronavirus information came from the White House. Last week  , Vice President Mike Pence had to correct Trump  about the rules on testing. In a White House briefing, Trump said “anybody that needs a test gets a test” for coronavirus, a misleading statement at the time and still not the case. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has badly lagged other countries in preparing a nationwide testing regime. Yet Trump repeated his claim on Thursday, stating, “Frankly, the testing has been going very smooth.”  Around the same time, across town on Capitol Hill, Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and serves on the White House coronavirus task force, was telling Congress that testing was going anything but smoothly.  “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” said Fauci. “This is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it. The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that.”  As of Thursday morning  , the CDC was testing only 100 people per day  , a small fraction of those seeking to be tested. Some additional tests were being administered by state public-health agencies and private laboratories, but still far below the rate of testing in other countries.   On Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”  On Feb. 26, Trump said at a coronavirus briefing, “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”  As of Thursday the United States recorded 1,300 cases, with 38 deaths.  "

Furthermore, as dividends are paid out of profits and retained earnings, a dividend-paying company is usually stable and has strong earnings growth potential. Thus, adding a dividend stock into one's portfolio enhances overall returns in the long run and adds a much-needed safety net amid wild market swings.Take Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble stock as an example. Both of these companies have consistently paid dividends for a very long period and uninterruptedly increased it for more than 50 years. That means their shareholders were paid even during the down years.Like Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, several stocks have consistently hiked their dividends.

Another trend “Insight Velocity,” he said, would bring cost into focus.“As cloud data warehouses and lakes have been broadly adopted, they have opened up the opportunity to live-query huge amounts of data directly. But when businesses use this technique, they can end up with runaway cloud compute costs,” he said.“On the data integration side, businesses should be able to choose between continuously updating and merging data (incurring higher compute costs) and doing an aggregate view (with lower costs),” he added.And from an analytics perspective, they should be able to choose between live-query (higher compute costs) and in-memory exploration, which can be both faster and cheaper, Mr. Babbar said.“By mapping out their unique needs, organisations can and will have to figure out how to raise the right queries in the right places,” he said.He said “Application Automation”, yet another trend, would trigger action in 2022.“The Application Programming Interface (API) economy has gradually opened newer ways for businesses, partners, customers, and even competitors to work together in interwoven joint initiatives powered by API integrations,” he said.“This makes the buy-versus-build decision less relevant, instead presenting the opportunity to assemble apps and orchestrate actions. Application automation is a strongly emerging area that removes the need to code these integrations, making the opportunity much more accessible to a wider variety of actors,” Mr. Babbar said.He said application automation would become more common due to the widespread adoption of SaaS applications and the increasing ease of automating actions in apps through API.

Get a bouffant,The bouffant is back!,arkansasonline.com,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The bouffant is back! The hairstyle, known for its round shape, with hair swept off the face and shellacked into place with quite a bit of hair spray, is symbolic of all that is retro. Think of Catherine Deneuve, Betty Draper in Mad Men and multiple first ladies (Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Jacqueline Kennedy). But the bouffant has made some notable appearances in fashion in the past month or so. Bella Hadid had one at the Marc Jacobs show in February. She wore a fitted black dress and white gloves, and her hair, styled by Guido Palau, was reminiscent of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Kaia Gerber was given a similar hairstyle in a Loewe publication showcasing its spring 2020 womenswear, with hair sculpted into place by Simone Mason while posing in gowns on the grounds of the Isamu Noguchi Garden of Peace in Paris. For the February cover of Self Service magazine, blond model Rebecca Longendyke has hair styled by Duffy -- just one name -- with a few variations: wavy, messy, even short. The current CR Fashion Book with Kim Kardashian West, Naomi Campbell and Cher on alternate covers has the threesome posing as a biker gang in long brunette bouffants with bangs. ""The inspiration was the 1960s and Priscilla Presley,"" said Serena Radaelli, who did Cher's hair. ""Cher said, 'Excuse me, I was alive then,' and showed us photos of herself in the '60s. ""Big hair is fearless in a sense,"" Radaelli said. ""The modernity for this shoot was the length of the hair. It didn't actually take that long to do."" The unspoken message of the bouffant was always that it was high maintenance. ""They used to be this glaring symbol that you were a lady of the leisure class, right?"" said Stellene Volandes, editor-in-chief of Town & Country. ""They said, 'Yes, I have time to go to Kenneth and spend the afternoon there and have him tease my hair high and eat sandwiches from William Poll.'"" She was referring to hairdresser Kenneth Battelle, who was a master of the bouffant. Marilyn Monroe and Kennedy were clients. Volandes said she would send those curious about the bouffant to stylists who know their way around an uptown clientele: John Barrett, Valery Joseph, Julien Farel or Serge Normant -- or to Paul Podlucky's apartment salon on New York's East 67th Street for real Upper East Side verisimilitude. In short, it's rich lady hair, perfect for showing off jewelry. Hadid at Marc Jacobs was draped in diamonds. Or think of Kennedy at the state dinner for the Shah of Iran with a sunburst brooch from the London jeweler Wartski in her hair. Rachel Tashjian, 30, a style writer at GQ who occasionally wears her own platinum blond hair in a baby bouff, said that the bouffant looks back and forward. It's looking back at visual culture and trends of the 1960s and '70s and also taking note of bourgeois ideas around a lady of leisure. ""There is real emerging interest in the performance of getting dressed the way a woman without a job might have, the way dressing was described in Diana Vreeland's memoir,"" she said. Vreeland, an editor of Vogue in the 1960s, wore her jet-black hair pulled off her face into, yes, a bouffant, perhaps best to showcase her signature red blush. Yet what the bouffant also conveys is how we invest time on ourselves right now.

Probably.  Tom Brady intends to retire after 22 seasons, according to ESPN and the NFL Network. Brady won a league-record seven Super Bowls, including six with the Patriots. His legendary career in New England earned him near universal recognition as the greatest quarterback to ever play and perhaps the greatest player in NFL history.  ESPN cited several factors behind Brady’s decision, including family and health.        News of the 44-year-old’s intentions broke early Saturday afternoon and sparked a series of soft denials from Brady’s camp. His father, Tom Brady Sr., decried ESPN’s report to the NFL Network, calling it “total conjecture.” Brady’s agent, Don Yee, released a statement indicating Brady would announce his decision within days.  “I understand the advance speculation about Tom’s future,” Yee’s statement read. “Without getting into the accuracy or inaccuracy of what’s being reported, Tom will be the only person to express his plans with complete accuracy. He knows the realities of the football business and planning calendar as well as anybody, so that should be soon.”                  NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport later described the pushback as being based on timing rather than truth. Brady’s athletic performance and recovery company, TB12 Sports, deleted a tweet Saturday that initially acknowledged his retirement. It listed several of Brady’s accomplishments before concluding: “Thank you for it all, @TomBrady.”  If he retires this offseason, Brady will finish as the league’s all-time passing leader with 85,520 career yards and 624 career touchdowns. He was a six-time All-Pro, 15-time Pro Bowler and three-time MVP. Brady also won five Super Bowl MVPs.  Brady has a 35-12 record in the playoffs, and reached the Super Bowl in half of the 20 regular seasons he completed as a starter. He owns dozens of league records, including most career postseason passing yards (13,049) and passing touchdowns (86).        Earlier in the week, Brady discussed the possibility of retirement in his podcast, “Let’s Go.”  “I said this a few years ago, it’s what relationships are all about,” Brady said. “It’s not always what I want. It’s what we want as a family. And I’m going to spend a lot of time with them and figure out in the future what’s next.”  Brady’s last game was a divisional-round loss against the Rams, one where he completed a 24-point comeback in the fourth quarter only to see the Los Angeles Rams edge his Buccaneers in the final seconds. In New England, comebacks were his hallmark.  Brady’s career began with three Super Bowl victories in his first four seasons as a starter. With Brady, the Patriots completed the only perfect 16-game regular season in NFL history. He won three more Super Bowls over his final years in New England, including a 25-point comeback victory over the Falcons, the largest rally in Super Bowl history.  Guregian: Time is right for Tom Brady to walk off into the sunset    After leaving the Patriots in March 2020 as a free agent, Brady signed with the Buccaneers. He lifted Tampa Bay to a title in his first season, blowing out the then defending champion Chiefs, 31-9.  In 2021, Brady's Bucs edged out the Patriots in a 19-17 regular-season meeting at Foxboro. The game brought together Brady and Bill Belichick, the greatest coach of all time, for the first time since their split. Belichick called Brady one of the original creators of the culture that launched the greatest dynasty the NFL has ever seen.  ""With his relentless competitiveness and longevity, he earned everyone's admiration and will be celebrated forever. It has been a privilege to coach Tom Brady for 20 years,"" Belichick's statement read in March 2020. ""Examples of Tom's greatness are limitless, going back even before he was drafted. We witnessed how he prepared when he wasn't playing, how he performed when he got his opportunity, what he did to continuously improve, his leadership, his mindset, the example he set, and, of course, the person he is.  ""I am extremely grateful for what he did for our team and for me personally. Sometimes in life, it takes some time to pass before truly appreciating something or someone but that has not been the case with Tom.

YOC mit moderatem Umsatzrückgang im H1/2020 - Steigerung der Profitabilität durch VIS.X(R)-Plattform Berlin, 19. August 2020 - Bis zum Ausbruch der Corona Pandemie hatte das Umsatzwachstum der YOC AG (ISIN DE0005932735) auf Konzernebene rund 20 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr betragen. Aufgrund der sich anschließenden Zurückhaltung der Werbetreibenden im Zeitraum März bis Mai 2020 musste die Gesellschaft vermehrt Auftragsstornierungen und -rückgänge hinnehmen. In Konsequenz betrug der Konzernumsatz in den ersten sechs Monaten des laufenden Geschäftsjahres 6,3 Mio. EUR (H1/2019: 6,8 Mio. EUR). Unmittelbar zu Beginn der Krise hat die Gesellschaft zur Begrenzung der wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen Gegenmaßnahmen eingeleitet und infolgedessen deutliche Kosteneinsparungen erzielt. Parallel zu dieser Entwicklung nahm der Umsatzanteil der eigenentwickelten Ad Tech-Produkte weiter zu, sodass sich die Rohertragsmarge der Gesellschaft in den ersten sechs Monaten 2020 auf 38,6 % (H1/2019: 37,3 %) steigerte. Im ersten Halbjahr 2020 konnte das operative Ergebnis vor Zinsen, Steuern und Abschreibungen (EBITDA)* auf Konzernebene trotz der Corona Pandemie im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum auf 0,4 Mio. EUR (Vorjahr: 0,05 Mio. EUR) erhöht werden. Somit setzt sich die stetige Ergebnisverbesserung der Gesellschaft weiter fort. Als unterstützende Maßnahme vereinbarte die Gesellschaft mit ihren Hausbanken die Bereitstellung von Betriebsmittellinien in Höhe von insgesamt 0,4 Mio. EUR und verfügt somit seit Beginn des dritten Quartals über weitere Liquiditätsspielräume. Dirk-Hilmar Kraus, CEO der YOC AG: ""Der automatisierte Handel unserer High-impact Werbeprodukte verhält sich in der Corona-Krise äußerst widerstandsfähig: Das Handelsvolumen unserer Technologieplattform VIS.X(R) wuchs im ersten Halbjahr 2020 im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um satte 91 %.

Conservative leader Douglas Ross has called on pro-Union parties to foster closer ties ahead of May's Holyrood election but has so far been snubbed. In an interview with the Record, Rennie said the Tories had a ""cat's chance in hell"" of ever taking power in Edinburgh and instead talked up the prospect of working closer with Anas Sarwar in the coming years. Labour and the Lib Dems formed a coalition in 1999 following the first ever Scottish Parliament election and renewed it again in 2003 in a deal that kept the SNP out of power. But both parties have since been swept aside as the Nationalists established themselves as the party of government at Holyrood over the last 14 years. Two polls published yesterday both predicted the SNP remains on course to emerge as the largest party once again in May and is on the verge of achieving an outright majority of MSPs for the second time in a decade.    Read More Related Articles    Read More Related Articles    Asked if a renewed Labour-Liberal coalition was the only way of removing Nicola Sturgeon's party from office, Rennie said: ""I'm a centre-left politician. I've had my differences with Labour in recent years over Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn.  ""But the one thing we agree on is the recovery from the pandemic. ""I think there is an embryonic alternative there. But there's a bit to go yet - Anas is just in the door - but he and I get on well. ""One thing is for sure - the Conservatives do not have a cat's chance in hell of removing the SNP from government. They don't have a broad enough appeal to win in Scotland.   ""They're only interested in their core vote and not attracting people back from the SNP. I am, and I think Anas is."" The Lib Dems won just five MSPs at the last Holyrood election after paying the price for the UK party forming a coalition government at Westminster under David Cameron. Rennie insisted his party would win more this time around but stopped short of making a prediction on numbers. ""We don't have any targets,"" he said. ""We are just looking to grow and to have more MSPs and greater influence so we can do the things that puts the recovery first. ""All the top priorities - mental health, education, jobs, the climate - that's what we're about.""   The election in May will also mark 10 years since the Fifer became leader of the Lib Dems in Scotland and he insists he has no plans to step down. ""I'm loving the job and the party is great with a dedicated membership base,"" he said. ""They've been through the wars but they stick together like glue. ""I'm optimistic we can enjoy more success in the years to come.  ""Wendy Chamberlain winning the North East Fife constituency in 2019 was a fantastic achievement."""

On Monday, Sri Lanka will begin talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan program, even as it seeks help from other countries, including neighboring India, and China.How did it get to this? Economic mismanagement by successive governments weakened Sri Lanka’s public finances, leaving its national expenditure in excess of its income, and the production of tradable goods and services at an inadequate level.The situation was exacerbated by deep tax cuts enacted by the Rajapaksa government soon after it took office in 2019, which came just months before the COVID-19 crisis.The pandemic wiped out parts of its economy — mainly the lucrative tourism industry — while an inflexible foreign exchange rate sapped remittances from its foreign workers.Rating agencies, concerned about government finances and its inability to repay large foreign debt, downgraded Sri Lanka’s credit ratings from 2020 onward, eventually locking the country out of international financial markets.But to keep its economy afloat, the government still leaned heavily on its foreign exchange reserves, eroding them by more than 70% in two years.By March, Sri Lanka’s reserves stood at only $1.93 billion, insufficient to even cover a month of imports, and leading to spiraling shortages of everything from diesel to some food items.JPMorgan analysts estimate the country’s gross debt servicing would amount to $7 billion this year, with the current account deficit coming in around $3 billion.What did the government do?Faced with a rapidly deteriorating economic environment, the Rajapaksa government chose to wait, instead of moving quickly and seeking help from the IMF and other sources.For months, opposition leaders and experts urged the government to act, but it held its ground, hoping for tourism to bounce back and remittances to recover.Newly appointed Finance Minister Ali Sabry said in an interview earlier this month that key officials within the government and Sri Lanka’s central bank did not understand the gravity of the problem and were reluctant to have the IMF step in. Sabry, along with a new central bank governor, was brought in as part of a new team to tackle the situation.But, aware of the brewing crisis, the government did seek help from countries, including India and China. Last December, the then finance minister traveled to New Delhi to arrange $1.9 billion in credit lines and swaps from India.A month later, Rajapaksa asked China to restructure repayments on around $3.5 billion of debt owed to Beijing, which in late 2021 also provided Sri Lanka with a $1.5 billion yuan-denominated swap.What happens next? Finance Minister Sabry will start talks with the IMF for a loan package of up to $3 billion over three years.An IMF program, which typically mandates fiscal discipline from borrowers, is also expected to help Sri Lanka draw assistance of another $1 billion from other multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.In all, the country needs around $3 billion in bridge financing over the next six months to help restore supplies of essential items including fuel and medicine.India is open to providing Sri Lanka with another $2 billion to reduce the country’s dependence on China, sources have said.Sri Lanka has also sought a further $500 million credit line from India for fuel.With China, too, the government is in discussions for a $1.5 billion credit line and a syndicated loan of up to $1 billion. Besides the swap last year, Beijing also extended a $1.3 billion syndicated loan to Sri Lanka at the start of the pandemic.

(TSX:CFP) says it will permanently shutter its Isle Pierre sawmill near Prince George later this year.  The company announced it will begin winding the mill down in the third quarter of this year.  It cited an ""insufficient supply of economically viable timber"" -- the result of the mountain pine beetle epidemic -- and a global contraction in demand for lumber, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, as the reasons for the decision to shut down the sawmill.  The closure will take 120 million board feet out of Canfor's production in B.C.  “Unfortunately, the ongoing economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the urgent need for Canfor to make this difficult decision,” Canfor CEO Don Kayne said in a press release.  “We know today’s announcement will have a significant impact on our employees, contractors, their families and the local communities, which we deeply regret. We will work hard to redeploy as many employees as possible to other opportunities throughout the company.”  But sawmill closures and curtailments were happening in B.C. before the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the second half of 2019, 3,000 sawmill workers lost their jobs to sawmill closures and curtailments in B.C., due to a shrinkage in the annual allowable cut, high stumpage prices and falling demand and prices for lumber in the U.S.  In addition to permanently shutting down the Isle Pierre mill, Canfor's pulp division, Canfor Pulp Products Inc. (TSX:CFX), plans to  curtail production at its Prince George Pulp and Paper and Intercontinental Pulp mills for four weeks starting July 6.  nbennett@biv.com  @nbennett_biv                    "

The two friends, who have known each other for 47 years, put their arms around each other and breathed sighs of relief.  Next, Vander Houwen said she would pack her clothes, food and other supplies to take to Barker’s nearby mobile home, where she would be staying for the near term.  And she was grateful for her friend. “I don’t what I’d do without her,” she said. But she had no idea what would happen over the long term. “This place is paid for,” Vander Houwen said. “I’m too old to start over again.”  On the corner of Reeves Avenue in the South China Lake trailer park, the remains of a mobile home were charred from the fire that burned most of it down last night. On the side porch, a couple women’s dresses, shades of pink and purple, still hung from hangers. In front of the house, a child’s bike helmet lay strewn across the front lawn next to deflated basketballs. Two cars, one melted and destroyed from the flames, were still parked in the driveway.  Next door, Bob Bloudeck, 70, was cleaning up his mobile home of everything that had fallen from his walls night before. He limped while he carried out the trash. He had been in his house with his 8-year old granddaughter when the mobile home next to his caught fire sometime during or after the earthquake, he said. Friday’s temblor had seriously scared both of them. “It was shaking so hard, I couldn’t get out of my chair,” Bloudeck said. “My granddaughter jumped into my lap and told me that she wanted mommy and daddy.”  Shortly after the shaking was over, he went outside to see that a fire had erupted in the house next door. Several neighbors rallied to stop the flames — they didn’t know if the family, who has several kids, was still inside. “We broke some of the windows of the house before the firemen came,” Bloudeck said. “We threw shovels and a fire extinguisher that wasn’t working through their windows.” Eventually, the firemen came and confirmed that no one was in the house.  Bloudeck has no plans to move from his mobile home where he has lived for three years. “I haven’t even thought about that,” he said. He has been a resident of Ridgecrest for thirty years and has felt many earthquakes in his time, he said, but never one as strong — or as scary — as this one.  "

V případě, že zaparkované vozidlo v databázi není, míří věc do přestupkového řízení. Zahraniční SPZ řeší magistrát, jinak mají pokuty na starosti městské části.„Pokud u vozidel uprchlíků z Ukrajiny není řidič vozidla zjištěn a ztotožněn přímo na místě, bude s vysokou pravděpodobností tato věc odložena. Česká republika může sice díky evropské směrnici nahlédnout do ‚registrů vozidel‘ ostatních členských států, nicméně to není případ vozidel registrovaných na Ukrajině,“ uvedl k tomu mluvčí Magistrátu Vít Hofman.Mluvčí městské policie Irena Seifertová sdělila, že na místě strážníci v podobných případech postupují standardním způsobem, tedy buď domluvou, předáním do přestupkového řízení nebo pokutou na místě. „Zákon neumožňuje žádné výjimky,“ řekla.Rezidentů je zatím málo, jde o desítky lidíNěkteré městské části evidují stížnosti obyvatel na parkování ukrajinských aut na modrých zónách. „Mohu potvrdit, že se na nás obracejí občané, kteří převážně telefonicky upozorňují na nesprávně zaparkované ukrajinské automobily,“ uvedl mluvčí Prahy 10 Jan Hamrník. Dodal, že radnice podněty předává městské policii.Ukrajinci, kteří do Prahy dorazili autem, mohou z rozhodnutí magistrátu zdarma parkovat v P R parkovišti na Černém Mostě. V Praze 3 pak radnice vyčlenila také místa v ulici U Nákladového nádraží a v Praze 7 mohou Ukrajinci svoje auta nechat na parkovišti před Výstavištěm.Ukrajinští uprchlíci si zároveň mohou na základě víza žádat o parkovací oprávnění v místě svého pobytu. Takových případů jsou podle mluvčí jednotlivých radnic zatím jednotky či desítky. Například v Praze 6 to podle mluvčího radnice Jiřího Hannicha zatím je 10 až 15 případů, stejně jako v Praze 10. V Praze 1 si o parkovací kartu podle mluvčího Petra Bidla zažádalo 14 řidičů. Mluvčí Prahy 3 Pavel Trojan sdělil, že jde o nejvýše 50 případů, ale že radnice žádosti na základě víza neevidují zvlášť, takže se jedná o dohad.

The former university instructor and one-time Liberal MP said he's running for mayor again because he doesn't believe anyone at city hall is doing enough to help people suffering from addictions.  Ouellette initially ran for mayor in 2014 in the wide-open race to succeed former mayor Sam Katz. He wound up finishing third behind Brian Bowman, who went on to serve two terms as mayor, and former NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis.  Ouellette then spent one term as the Liberal MP for Winnipeg Centre, serving from 2015 to 2019, when he was defeated by the NDP's Leah Gazan.    Ouellette said an incident at Portage Place in 2016 sowed the seeds for his second mayoral run.   A young Indigenous woman from northern Manitoba came forward at one of the meet-and-greet sessions he used to hold at the mall and said she had started using illicit drugs within six weeks of moving to Winnipeg and was forced into the sex trade to pay for the drugs, he said.  Ouellette could not get help for the woman because it was a Friday afternoon and social services were not available, he said.  ""It seems we lack a bit of leadership in our city,"" he said. ""I think we need to get people around the table.""  Ouellette acknowledged addictions treatment is a provincial responsibility, and there are many organizations working to help people get medical help — but no one at city hall is working well enough with the province and the federal government, he said.  ""I don't think people adequately understand how the organizational interactions need to occur between all the different levels of government, between businesses, between average citizens, between community organizations to actually get things done,"" he said.  He also wants Winnipeg to be safe enough for kids to ride Winnipeg Transit at night.  He promised specific plans to improve safety and help people with addictions later in the campaign.  Ouellette said he has hired Eric Stewart, his former federal campaign manager, to manage his mayoral campaign.  Winnipeg elects a new mayor on Oct. 26. Candidates must register in order to raise or spend money on their campaigns.    St. James Coun. Scott Gillingham, business consultant Jenny Motkaluk, Willderness Supply owner Rick Shone, security company owner Don Woodstock and activist Chris Clacio have also registered to run for mayor.  Business owner Shaun Loney said he will register on Wednesday. River Heights-Fort Garry Coun. John Orlikow said he will register within the next three weeks.    Amid speculation of a mayoral run, Manitoba Families Minister Rochelle Squires said she will not address her intentions until the legislative session ends on June 1."

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved. They must also not promote any commercial business, involve any person or organization that promotes hatred of any person or class of persons or otherwise involves illegal activity or contain any “inflammatory, obscene or libellous statement.”  In an emailed statement Monday, the city said the intent of  proclamations is to “celebrate and recognize organizations and events that are meaningful to our community and its residents.” Part of the evaluation process considers if the organization requesting the proclamation is local or has a provincial chapter, it continued.  A two-page city document that can be found online  regarding proclamation requests and the associated bylaw states the event being proclaimed must be relevant to Regina or Saskatchewan. The city was unable to provide any documentation that outlines criteria in further detail as of press time.  "

Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.                    Methods: We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14–24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics.                    Results: Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020.        Conclusions: Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing. Sustained public health efforts should focus on maintaining youth engagement with accurate public information and youth-centered messaging promoting prevention measures to protect the health and well-being of youth and their friends and family.                   Introduction       Adolescents and young adults have been shown to be at lower risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVD-19) morbidity and mortality with asymptomatic and less serious cases skewed toward younger individuals.[1,2] As a result, pandemic impacts on this age group are largely related to interruptions in education, work, and social interactions.[3–5] Evidence suggests, however, asymptomatic youth may contribute to pandemic progression as ""silent spreaders,"" that is, individuals who transmit the disease without exhibiting symptoms.[1,2,6,7] Concerns regarding the health and well-being of youth as well as their potential role as silent spreaders make this group, nearly 13% of the US population (aged 15–24 years), important in understanding the epidemiology of this pandemic and guiding ongoing public health efforts.[8]                    Youth are also commonly depicted as being unengaged in current events, unenthusiastic about political engagement, and generally disconnected.[9–13] Despite increased visibility of youth in advocacy, particularly focused on gun violence in schools, climate change, and social justice, the prevailing depiction of youth continues to be overwhelmingly, and sometimes inaccurately, apathetic and negative.[14–19] Psychologists and media have further labeled young adults as reward driven, lacking empathy, and increasingly self-absorbed.[20–26] However, many of these characteristics are part of normative neuro-biologic development and play important roles in learning, relationship development, and risk-taking behaviors essential to adolescent growth.[21,27]                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, these views of adolescents and young adults have gained additional traction with reports of these age groups ignoring social distancing guidelines to pack bars, visit beaches, and convene in large groups with others.[28–30] Insight on youth behaviors and their perceptions are limited, however, as is scientific knowledge of COVID-19, resulting in a need for continued efforts to understand the many facets of the pandemic. Our study aims to assess the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of adolescents and young adults to discern their understanding, feelings, and behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they evolved as the pandemic progressed.

The sharing of pornographic material is also punishable with prison time and hefty fines under the country’s laws, which are based on Islamic law, or Shariah.Late on Saturday, videos and photographs depicting over a dozen naked women, lined up on a balcony while being filmed in Dubai’s upscale Marina neighborhood in broad daylight, splashed across social media. It came as a shock in the federation of seven Arab sheikhdoms, where tamer behavior, like kissing in public or drinking alcohol without a license, has landed people in jail. State-linked newspaper The National reported it appeared to be a “publicity stunt,” without elaborating. Dubai police said those arrested over the “indecent” video had been referred to the public prosecution.“Such unacceptable behaviors,” the police statement said, “do not reflect the values and ethics of Emirati society.”The UAE, while liberal in many regards compared to its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression. People have been jailed for their comments and videos online. The country’s majority state-owned telecom companies block access to major pornographic websites. "

This time the garment was purple and from Gucci.  To complete her look for Archie's christening today Kate added a red headband by London milliner Juliette Botterill.  The christening comes as Meghan and Harry face continued and growing backlash surrounding the event, as they insisted it be kept private.   The service took place in a tiny chapel inside Windsor Castle, with many of the guests arriving discreetly by a back entrance to the grounds.   The royal couple have refused to reveal who their son's godparents are despite billing the public £2.4million for renovations to Frogmore cottage.   A handful of royals fans gathered in Windsor for the event and, though excited, some suggested they have been left 'disappointed' that the public will not get to see any of the private ceremony or find out who has been chosen as godparents.   Mystery surrounded the private event, with the royal couple refusing to allow media into the event, and using a royal loophole to avoid telling public who had been chosen as godparents.    Several experts suggested it was a disappointing move, and would upset those who loved the couple the most.    Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, suggested Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan Markle, 37, had 'really upset the people who loved them the most' with the move, telling the  Daily Express  Seward went on to reveal: 'The secrecy and evasiveness of the whole situation has been so mismanaged. It's a real shame.'   The date for Archie's christening had to be pushed back by two days, after his parents discovered that both the Queen and Prince Charles had prior engagements on the first date.  While the Queen has bowed out graciously in order to spend a long planned weekend with Prince Philip in Sandringham, after a family conference it was decided that the date should be moved to accommodate Prince Charles.  He was away in Wales on the previously planned date to celebrate 50 years of him being Prince of the country.   Photographer and former soldier Chris Allerton will capture shots of Archie's christening today, having previous taken private photographs for Meghan and Harry.  Allerton is said to have formed a close bond with the couple, having taken private pictures during Archie's photocall as well as the royal wedding.    He is said to have developed his first roll of film at just eight years old and according to his website 'has been hooked on photography since'.  Allerton left the British Army in 2001 and went on to Lichfield Studios in Notting Hill.   It was here that he learnt the skills needed to master professional photography.  He now travels all over the world and has clients such as Harpers Bazaar, Tatler and broadsheet newspapers.   After taking photos at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May last year, Allerton posted his thanks to the couple.  He said: 'It was a great honour to be asked to photograph The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding day in May. I am delighted that Their Highnesses chose this photograph for their Christmas card.'    Allerton had previous studies at the University of Reading, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Prior to that he attended the prestigious Stowe School in Buckinghamshire.  In 1992 he started his Army career and served there until 2001. During his time in the Army he worked for the Household Cavalry.  He was commissioned into The Life Guards, Household Cavalry, before serving in Bosnia in 1994 and Singapore and Argentina in 1995.  His last posting was in 1998 at the Adjutant New College at The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. He resigned commission in 2000.    In 2001 he started work as a photographic director for Photographic Records. He worked there for over two years.  He then decided to start his own company Allerton Photography, which has offices in both London and Wiltshire.    Although her majesty has not been able to attend all of her great-grandchildren's christenings, having missed Prince Louis's baptism last year, it is understood that she would have like to be present for Prince Harry's big celebration with his first child.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly shunned celebrities as godparents, instead turning to a close group of friends who played a key role at their wedding.   It has emerged in recent days that the couple are using a royal loophole to ensure baby Archie's godparents remain a secret.   Under Church of England rules, the details of all baptisms, including the baby's godparents, are a matter of public record and can be obtained easily for a small fee.  Royal sources have said that Meghan and Harry picked 'close and old friends' for the roles amid a backlash over the royal couple's refusal to identify them because they are 'private citizens'.       We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Temperatures are likely to remain at around 18C throughout the day, and will continue to be around the same level over the weekend.However, the mercury will then begin to rise from Monday, hitting highs of around 23C by the middle of the week, as the prospect of showers also begins to diminish. Before then though, the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the west of England ahead of the arrival of storms this afternoon.Experts warn of difficult driving conditions, delays to train services, short term loss of power, flooding and building damage as a result.Met Office Chief Forecaster Neil Armstrong said: 'A period of showery conditions during summer always brings the possibility of some of those showers turning heavy and thundery, possibly with hail.'Some of these showers will be slow-moving so that could increase local impacts with rainfall totals reaching 30mm or more in isolated locations. In the heaviest showers these could be accompanied by hail and lightning.'

This will bring the prospect of drier, brighter and more settled conditions for much of the UK.Met Office Deputy Chief Forecaster Daniel Rudman said: 'We anticipate that the area of high pressure currently over the Azores will increasingly extend towards the South West of the UK.  'This will lead to leading to a good deal of warmer and mostly dry weather, especially across the south, although it may also bring cloud and rain into the northwest at times.'With the position of this high pressure bringing air in from the Atlantic, it unlikely to encourage exceptionally high temperatures as those are normally associated with a southerly flow of air from southern Europe or North Africa. 'However, we are likely to see a shift away from the below-average temperatures to values somewhat above average possibly even extending to very warm especially across the south.'

This time the garment was purple and from Gucci.  To complete her look for Archie's christening today Kate added a red headband by London milliner Juliette Botterill.  The christening comes as Meghan and Harry face continued and growing backlash surrounding the event, as they insisted it be kept private.   The service took place in a tiny chapel inside Windsor Castle, with many of the guests arriving discreetly by a back entrance to the grounds.   The royal couple have refused to reveal who their son's godparents are despite billing the public £2.4million for renovations to Frogmore cottage.   A handful of royals fans gathered in Windsor for the event and, though excited, some suggested they have been left 'disappointed' that the public will not get to see any of the private ceremony or find out who has been chosen as godparents.   Mystery surrounded the private event, with the royal couple refusing to allow media into the event, and using a royal loophole to avoid telling public who had been chosen as godparents.    Several experts suggested it was a disappointing move, and would upset those who loved the couple the most.    Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, suggested Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan Markle, 37, had 'really upset the people who loved them the most' with the move, telling the  Daily Express  Seward went on to reveal: 'The secrecy and evasiveness of the whole situation has been so mismanaged. It's a real shame.'   The date for Archie's christening had to be pushed back by two days, after his parents discovered that both the Queen and Prince Charles had prior engagements on the first date.  While the Queen has bowed out graciously in order to spend a long planned weekend with Prince Philip in Sandringham, after a family conference it was decided that the date should be moved to accommodate Prince Charles.  He was away in Wales on the previously planned date to celebrate 50 years of him being Prince of the country.   Photographer and former soldier Chris Allerton will capture shots of Archie's christening today, having previous taken private photographs for Meghan and Harry.  Allerton is said to have formed a close bond with the couple, having taken private pictures during Archie's photocall as well as the royal wedding.    He is said to have developed his first roll of film at just eight years old and according to his website 'has been hooked on photography since'.  Allerton left the British Army in 2001 and went on to Lichfield Studios in Notting Hill.   It was here that he learnt the skills needed to master professional photography.  He now travels all over the world and has clients such as Harpers Bazaar, Tatler and broadsheet newspapers.   After taking photos at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May last year, Allerton posted his thanks to the couple.  He said: 'It was a great honour to be asked to photograph The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding day in May. I am delighted that Their Highnesses chose this photograph for their Christmas card.'    Allerton had previous studies at the University of Reading, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology.

Managing partner Eric Holoman will take over her duties as the club searches for a replacement.  “On behalf of ownership and the entire Sparks organization, I’d like to thank Penny Toler for a successful and historic tenure with the organization,” Holoman said. “Penny is a foundational figure in the growth of the WNBA and helped lead our franchise to perennial playoff success and multiple titles. We wish her nothing but the best moving forward.”  The Sparks said in a statement that a national search for a new general manager would begin immediately.  Toler played for the Sparks from 1997-99. During her tenure as general manager the club won WNBA titles in 2001, 2002 and 2016 while qualifying for the playoffs 18 times.  She scored the first basket in WNBA history and averaged 10.0 points, 4.0 assists and 2.8 rebounds in 88 games, 62 of which she started.  The 5-foot-8 guard from Washington, D.C., played at Long Beach State and became the 49ers’ career leader in assists and free-throw percentage at the time. She was the conference player of the year in 1988 and co-player of the year in 1989.  Dan Loumena has worked myriad jobs at the Los Angeles Times since joining the staff in 1996, including as a page designer, copy editor, assignment editor and Web producer. Loumena was part of the first group of print journalists at The Times to delve full time into the wonders of the website, helping the department move into the digital-first, round-the-clock coverage.  Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg could forfeit a guaranteed four years and $100 million in search of a better deal on the open market this offseason.  Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay finally got running back Todd Gurley into something resembling an early rhythm, against the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night.  Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw will start Game 2 of the NLDS against the Nationals, and if the series goes five games, he’ll be rested enough to pitch again.  Dabo Swinney makes $9.3 million per year as coach of Clemson’s two-time national champion football team. So you might think he would like to see his players paid for their work. And they are, he says. With an education.  "

Das klappt mittlerweile auch mit einem kleinen Crossover. Und dabei startet der Ford Puma ST noch nicht einmal in der teuren Premiumliga - doch Spaß macht er wie ein großer.                                                                                                                                                An sich ist der Ford Puma ST nicht viel mehr als ein höher gelegter Fiesta ST - möchte man meinen: drei Zylinder, 200 PS und jede Menge gute Laune hinter dem Steuer und auf der Straße. Bereits die Sportversion des kleinen Einsteiger-Ford macht jede Menge Laune. Doch einfach Lust auf mehr? Dann ist der Puma ST genau der richtige. Dem kann man selbst beim zweiten Hinsehen eigentlich nur eines vorwerfen, denn bei so viel Tatendrang und Fahrspaß würde man sich einen Allradantrieb wünschen. Den hat Ford zwar im Programm - aber nicht beim 200 PS starken Puma. Schade, denn wenn man es so richtig krachen lässt, zerren die 200 allzu munteren Pferdchen mehr an der Vorderachse, als einem lieb ist. Die optionale Vorderachsquersperre kommt bei flotter Gangart schneller als ihre Grenzen, als es sich der kurvenhungrige Pilot wünschen würde. Das Sperrdifferenzial gibt es im Sportpaket zusammen mit Launch-Control und einer besonderer Schaltpunktanzeige. Doch sonst gibt es kaum etwas zu meckern, denn sogar an das zu einem sonoren Brabbeln umgearbeitete Rasseln des 1,5-Liter-Dreizylinders kann sich hören lassen. Der Puma ST ist fraglos ein Dreizylinder - aber eine spaßiger. Wie gut der mit einem Zylinderquartett wäre - darüber möchte man gar nicht nachdenken.

Das ohnehin ansehnliche Design des Puma wird durch den ST-Sportdress noch eine ganze Ecke schnittiger. Dunkler Wabenkühlergrill, sportliche Schweller und schmucke 19-Zöller - ja dieser Kölner findet an jeder Straßenecke schnell seine Freunde. Dafür, dass andere Verkehrsteilnehmer die Daumen nach oben recken, ist der kleine Crossover dann allerdings doch etwas zu dezent, doch wer den zweiten Gang in der City etwas höher ausdreht, als es eigentlich sein müsste, der erntet wohl nicht nur im Rheinland aufmerksame Blicke. Besonders auf seine Kosten kommt jedoch der Pilot gewordene Fahrer, wenn er das Gaspedal mit etwas lockerer Leine bewegt. Der Dreizylinder kennt man aus de Hause Ford nur allzu gut - und im Zylinderterzett gehört zum Besten, was man derzeit bekommen kann. 1,5 Liter Hubraum, 147 kW / 200 PS und ein maximales Drehmoment von 320 Nm, das zwischen 2.500 und 3.500 U/min anliegt. Alles keine Werte, die einem die Sprache rauben, aber man ist in der Liga der Kleinen unterwegs und da sind die Leistungsdaten allemal imposant. Das gilt zugegeben nur eingeschränkt für die Höchstgeschwindigkeit, denn 220 km/h sind ordentlich, aber für einen echten Sportler im Konkurrenzumfeld doch etwas wenig. Andere Fahrzeuge mit 200 PS sind 240 oder gar 250 km/h schnell. Immerhin spurtet der Fronttriebler aus dem Stand in 6,7 Sekunden auf Tempo 100. Der Normverbrauch: gute 6,0 Liter Super pro 100 Kilometer.                                                                                                                      Allerdings wird es bei hohen Geschwindigkeiten im knapp 1,4 Tonnen schweren Puma ST recht laut und man merkt ihm seine technische Basis an. Dabei ist er nicht ganz so bissig und sportlich wie der eng verbrüderte Ford Fiesta ST, jedoch im Alltag kaum weniger sportlich und bietet dabei deutlich mehr Variabilität. Mit zwei Erwachsenen und zwei Kindern lässt es sich im Innern des sportlichsten aller Pumas gut aushalten. Dabei ist das Komfortniveau nennenswert höher und die Lenkung kaum weniger direkt als beim kleinen Bruder Fiesta ST, der vom gleichen Dreizylinder befeuert wird. Das Fahrwerk: eine der besten Seiten des Puma ST. Gerade das Bypass-Ventil der Zweirohr-Stoßdämpfer hat einen wesentlichen Anteil an der erhöhten Langstreckentauglichkeit. Das große Kurvenvergnügen gehört seinen Ursprung jedoch nicht nur in der gelungenen Gesamtabstimmung, sondern liegt nicht zuletzt an einer überraschend fahraktiven Hinterachse, der das Stabilitätsprogramm im Grenzbereich je nach angewähltem Fahrprogramm sogar leichten Auslauf gewährt. Am ledernen Sportlenker kann man die einzelnen Fahrmodi zwischen den Stufen Normal, Eco, Sport und Rennstrecke durchschalten, was nicht nur Lenkung und Gaspedalannahme, sondern auch ESP beeinflusst.                                                                                                                                                 Klasse sind die wohl konturierten Dinamica-Sportsitze aus dem Hause Recaro. Die helfen nicht nur im schnellen Galopp, sondern gefallen auch mit ihrem hohen Langstreckenkomfort. Gut in der Hand liegen das griffige Sportlenkrad, dessen Leder sich etwas wertigen anfühlen könnte und der Schaltknauf der manuellen Sechsgang-Handschaltung, die einmal mehr zeigt, wie viel Laune es machen kann, sich in der Handarbeit zu betätigen. Noch schöner wäre es jedoch, wenn Ford den potenziellen Kunden die Wahl zwischen Handschaltung und einem automatisierten Getriebe wie einer Doppelkupplung geben würde. Aktuell bleibt es beim Handschalter. Qualitätsanmutung und Verarbeitung zeigen, dass Ford seit längerem auf dem rechten Weg ist, doch gerade Instrumente und Bedienelemente könnten auch in dieser Liga schicker und wertiger sein. Das gilt auch für das 12,3 Zoll große Kombiinstrument hinter dem Steuer oder das Multifunktionsdisplay in der Mitte der Armaturentafel. Passt alles, doch es gibt Raum nach oben.                                                                                                                      Ebenso wie das Raumangebot geht auch der Laderaum des 4,23 Meter langen Crossovers in Ordnung. Der Laderaum schluckt 456 Liter, die sich durch Umlegen der Rückbank auf 1.216 Liter erweitern lassen - inklusiv der 81 Liter großen Ablagebox unter dem Kofferraum. In Sachen Ausstattung hat der kleine Kölner einiges auf dem Kasten. Dabei hat der geneigte Kunde die Wahl und kann sich zwischen dem Ford Puma ST und dem besser ausstaffierten Puma ST-X entscheiden, der trotz des verräterischen Zusatzbuchstabens keinen Allradantrieb bietet. So startet der Ford Puma ST bei 30.121 Euro, während für den ST-X mindestens 32.071 Euro fällig werden. Serienmäßig sind nicht nur beheizte Sportsitze, LED-Scheinwerfer, 19-Zöller oder Navigationssystem, sondern auch Soundsystem und eine beheizbare Frontscheibe. Für beide Varianten sind acht Karosserie-Lackierungen lieferbar, wobei dem kompakten Kraftmeier gerade nicht nur das coole grau-uni, sondern auch weiß oder grün bestens steht.

Over the years I have seen many letters published in your newspaper whose views I have both agreed with and disagreed with.  For the most part there was usually an even spread of both sides of view here when it came to US, UK, Israeli and Nato events taking place worldwide.  Over the past years, however, I have noticed a gradual slide toward publishing more anti-US, anti-UK, anti-Israeli and anti-Nato letters than before.   Perhaps this is down to persons in this category being more vocal and writing more letters, but it is an observation nevertheless. It seems that if an American military plane lands in Shannon, or Israel comes under attack from Hamas, we only ever get a one-sided, biased view of events.  Last year, for example, when Israel and Hamas were fighting, the coverage in not only your newspaper but in the Irish media in general was totally one-sided. I’m not Jewish or Israeli and have never been to Israel, but as a reader who likes to see both viewpoints, I cannot but notice the one-sided views published in your newspaper when such events occur. For years, I’ve always been saying I must write in about this or about that but have never done so up until today.  With the week that’s in it (the invasion of Ukraine), I was quite put out to read a letter in your paper by a Mr O’Cathail in relation to his views on Russia, and this prompted me to write a response. This is my very first letter to any newspaper, so if you get a chance, I would appreciate it if you’d publish it.   Sean O’Dubhda, Ballinteer, Dublin 16   The EU must get tougher with war criminal Putin  The  Russian invasion of Ukraine is the gravest war crime since Adolf Hitler’s invasion of western Europe.    The EU was initially established as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. One of its primary objectives was to prevent any country in Europe invading another European country.   The EU needs to assert itself very quickly and tackle Russian aggression. All Russian ambassadors and their staff deserve to be fired out of every European capital immediately.  Russian assets in every member state should be seized by the individual member states and all Russian bank accounts should be frozen. All Russian companies should be delisted from All European bourses immediately, and under no circumstances should any Russian firm be allowed to raise capital in Europe. Europe stands on the edge of the abyss, Vladimir Putin wants to piece back the Soviet Union and invading Ukraine is only the start of his imperial Russian dream.  The EU needs to stand united against Putin and freeze him and his corrupt oligarchs out.    Kieran O Regan, Dublin 9     We need a brave titan like Merkel to lead right now  The  news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine was frightening.  That soon moved to petrification on the realisation that the calibre of leadership in the West is banal.  The grey suits appeared one after the other spouting insults and little else.  This was particularly the case with the noisy neighbours whose parliament these days is filled to the gills with leafy-suburb types convulsed and outraged at the very idea that anyone but themselves would have the cheek to invade another country.  It is abundantly clear that unless we move quickly to fill this leadership void, things can only get decidedly worse. We need someone who knows that resolving disagreement is best done with ideas and words and has the necessary skills to put that into practice – someone devoid of ego and focused only on serving.   There is such a titan out there with these skills in abundance and who has also demonstrated the ability to manage Mr Putin.  Step forward, Angela Merkel, our need is great, your time has come.    Jim O’Sullivan, Rathedmond, Co Sligo    The stakes are too high for this fevered rhetoric  When  will this moral posturing stop? As we lurch like lemmings toward the abyss, the mantras of democracy, territorial integrity and freedom are  bandied about with ever-increasing evangelical zeal, especially by those who supported the destruction of Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Libya and Serbia.  Diplomacy has no chance in such a fervid climate, and the consequences of failure do not bear thinking about. One artillery hit, even accidental, on any of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear power stations risks another Chernobyl at the very least.   Almost 40 years ago, Patrick Comerford published a short book,   Do You Want to Die for Nato? . The Taoiseach, diplomats, various talking heads and armchair warriors need to reflect urgently on that question.   Dr Eugene Egan, Glasheen, Co Cork   Biden and Co echo the People’s Front of Judea  There  is a scene in   Life of Brian  where the People’s Front of Judea (PFJ) discuss their progress in kicking the Romans out of Judea. The discussion changes and it’s stated that they need to stop talking and start doing something. As one committee member says: “It’s actions that count, not words.” Just then, Judith arrives, exclaiming that Brian has been arrested. The PFJ revert to type and start wording a new motion issuing a statement they later read to Brian as he is on the cross.  The leader, Reg, adds a personal note of his “own admiration for what you are doing for us, Brian, at what must be, after all, for you, a very difficult time”. If you replace Brian with Ukraine and listen to the limp efforts from European and American diplomats and politicians against Putin’s imperialist aggression, you can’t help thinking they are just as useless as the PFJ.   Jason Fitzharris, Swords, Co Dublin    To protect our democracy we must now join Nato  Ireland  is not a member of Nato. However, we have airports and facilities for refuelling aircraft that could be useful for European defence.  Ukraine is a democracy and would like to join the EU and Nato.  The invasion from Russia and Belarus is ultimately an attack on the EU and Nato.  We do not have modern military resources, but should consider becoming a member of Nato in solidarity with Ukraine and EU countries that will probably face threats from Russia within a few years.  No EU country has any moral right to claim neutrality at present.   Brian Patrick McArdle, Newbridge, Co Kildare    We should invoke our old anti-apartheid solidarity  We are  a small country and if anybody knows about foreign occupation, we do. Although small in the 1980s, Dunnes Stores workers’ refusal to sell South African produce due to apartheid caused the then Irish government to be the first western administration to ban that country’s goods in 1987. This was a big step in the dismantling of apartheid and was acknowledged by Nelson Mandela.  The invasion of Ukraine has already caused the deaths of children, and as such, Vladimir Putin has to be recognised as a war criminal. I would suggest the closure of the Russian embassy, which apparently is a very important one for the Russians for many reasons, and the banning of Russian aircraft from Irish airspace if not already done. Yes, expect retaliation, but many countries stood up for us in our fight for freedom.    Dr Aidan Hampson, Artane, Dublin 5     Taiwan and China the next concern in all of this  Nobody  should really be surprised that Vladimir Putin and Russian forces have invaded  Ukraine .  The next obvious concern  will be with what happens in Taiwan. Will China be emboldened by the feeble protests and actions of the West in reaction to the invasion of Ukraine? The reality is that nobody wants to get into a real, possibly nuclear, war . The US is hopefully sensible enough to avoid an all-out war.   Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia      "

OSWEGO COUNTY – According to the Oswego County Health Department, there have been a total of 471 additional cases of COVID-19 (data from May 9 to May 15). The following report reflects data collected from Monday, May 9 through Sunday, May 15:   Number of lab/provider tests: 3,281 Number of lab/provider positive cases: 344 Percentage of lab/provider positive cases: 10.48% Number of at-home positive test results: 127  The County’s COVID-19 community level remains “high” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The federal agency recommends that people in “high” areas wear a face mask indoors in public spaces, keep COVID-19 vaccinations up to date and get tested if they have symptoms. Individuals at high risk for severe illness may need to take additional precautions, such as avoiding poorly ventilated or crowded spaces. An additional 18 Oswego County residents were hospitalized due to COVID-19 between Sunday, May 8 and Saturday, May 14, according to the hospitalization report received by the Oswego County Health Department. New hospitalization numbers are not part of a running total of hospitalizations.  Oswego County Public Health Director Jiancheng Huang reminds residents that while this number is down slightly this week, the proportion of those aged 64 years and over who are hospitalized has remained high over the last two weeks.  “Vaccines remain the best tool for protecting our community – especially our most vulnerable populations,” he said. “They reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalizations, and death. Over 800 vaccinations were administered to residents during the last week. I encourage residents to continue taking this precaution to avoid virus spread. Being up to date on your COVID-19 vaccinations ensures you the best protection possible.

This time the garment was purple and from Gucci.  To complete her look for Archie's christening today Kate added a red headband by London milliner Juliette Botterill.  The christening comes as Meghan and Harry face continued and growing backlash surrounding the event, as they insisted it be kept private.   The service took place in a tiny chapel inside Windsor Castle, with many of the guests arriving discreetly by a back entrance to the grounds.   The royal couple have refused to reveal who their son's godparents are despite billing the public £2.4million for renovations to Frogmore cottage.   A handful of royals fans gathered in Windsor for the event and, though excited, some suggested they have been left 'disappointed' that the public will not get to see any of the private ceremony or find out who has been chosen as godparents.   Mystery surrounded the private event, with the royal couple refusing to allow media into the event, and using a royal loophole to avoid telling public who had been chosen as godparents.    Several experts suggested it was a disappointing move, and would upset those who loved the couple the most.    Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, suggested Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan Markle, 37, had 'really upset the people who loved them the most' with the move, telling the  Daily Express  Seward went on to reveal: 'The secrecy and evasiveness of the whole situation has been so mismanaged. It's a real shame.'   The date for Archie's christening had to be pushed back by two days, after his parents discovered that both the Queen and Prince Charles had prior engagements on the first date.  While the Queen has bowed out graciously in order to spend a long planned weekend with Prince Philip in Sandringham, after a family conference it was decided that the date should be moved to accommodate Prince Charles.  He was away in Wales on the previously planned date to celebrate 50 years of him being Prince of the country.   Photographer and former soldier Chris Allerton will capture shots of Archie's christening today, having previous taken private photographs for Meghan and Harry.  Allerton is said to have formed a close bond with the couple, having taken private pictures during Archie's photocall as well as the royal wedding.    He is said to have developed his first roll of film at just eight years old and according to his website 'has been hooked on photography since'.  Allerton left the British Army in 2001 and went on to Lichfield Studios in Notting Hill.   It was here that he learnt the skills needed to master professional photography.  He now travels all over the world and has clients such as Harpers Bazaar, Tatler and broadsheet newspapers.   After taking photos at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May last year, Allerton posted his thanks to the couple.  He said: 'It was a great honour to be asked to photograph The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding day in May. I am delighted that Their Highnesses chose this photograph for their Christmas card.'    Allerton had previous studies at the University of Reading, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Prior to that he attended the prestigious Stowe School in Buckinghamshire.  In 1992 he started his Army career and served there until 2001. During his time in the Army he worked for the Household Cavalry.  He was commissioned into The Life Guards, Household Cavalry, before serving in Bosnia in 1994 and Singapore and Argentina in 1995.  His last posting was in 1998 at the Adjutant New College at The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. He resigned commission in 2000.    In 2001 he started work as a photographic director for Photographic Records. He worked there for over two years.  He then decided to start his own company Allerton Photography, which has offices in both London and Wiltshire.    Although her majesty has not been able to attend all of her great-grandchildren's christenings, having missed Prince Louis's baptism last year, it is understood that she would have like to be present for Prince Harry's big celebration with his first child.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly shunned celebrities as godparents, instead turning to a close group of friends who played a key role at their wedding.   It has emerged in recent days that the couple are using a royal loophole to ensure baby Archie's godparents remain a secret.   Under Church of England rules, the details of all baptisms, including the baby's godparents, are a matter of public record and can be obtained easily for a small fee.  Royal sources have said that Meghan and Harry picked 'close and old friends' for the roles amid a backlash over the royal couple's refusal to identify them because they are 'private citizens'.       We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Gladbach extended its lead at the top of Group B and put more pressure on Real Madrid and Inter Milan, who faced each other later Wednesday.             Gladbach was already two goals up before Swiss striker Embolo leapt to hit the ball in over his head after it was headed on at a free kick, leaving his marker Alan Patrick as a mere spectator.           Embolo had a large part in Gladbach's first goal, too, as he charged into the penalty area off a pass from Lars Stindl and was brought down by Serhiy Kryvtsov's desperate tackle. Stindl stepped up to hit the resulting penalty and sent goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov the wrong way.           Another desperate Shakhtar challenge gave away a corner from which Nico Elvedi headed in Gladbach's second goal.           In a quiet second half, Oscar Wendt made it 4-0 when his free kick cross eluded everyone in the box and went in at the far post.           Shakhtar was a shadow of the team which beat Madrid 3-2 earlier in the group stage and didn't record a shot on goal until the 83rd minute. Just as in Gladbach's 6-0 win over Shakhtar in Ukraine earlier this month, the German team was in total control.             There was a minute's silence in tribute to Diego Maradona before the game.           ___           More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports                                           "

A police officer has resigned after breaching COVID-19 border restrictions. Border checks are seen at the border between New South Wales and Queensland'These actions could have seriously compromised the health and safety of all Territorians,' Deputy Commissioner Murray Smalpage said in a statement.'What is most disappointing is the action of the former police officer.'We do not discriminate when it comes to disciplining those who fail to abide rules.'The former officer was accompanied by a 28-year-old woman and men aged 26, 27 and 29. They were all quarantined along with two close contacts, women aged 19 and 24.The officer has since started self-isolation and has been slapped with an infringement for contravening an emergency declaration.On Saturday the Territory reported a fresh COVID-19 diagnosis - that of a woman who arrived on a flight from Melbourne.She is the partner of a Darwin man who tested positive on Friday, with the couple now under the care of the local health services.The case takes the total number of COVID-19 infections reported in the NT to 34, all related to international or interstate travel.The Northern Territory government has said it will employ an extra 100 frontline health workers to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.The extra staff will allow for ongoing border screening of passengers arriving from interstate and will help manage people in supervised quarantine.They will also be trained in contact tracing.'We know there is no vaccine, there is no cure, and COVID-19 has no end date,' Health Minister Natasha Fyles said.'Our frontline health staff are integral to our response to COVID-19 and they have done an incredible job in trying times.'

Many seasons saw cancellations early on including the competitive swim season, hockey, basketball and many others. While baseball was allowed to proceed later in the summer, it was still a truncated season compared to seasons prior. Heading into the fall, while it was hopeful sports in southern Alberta would return to normal, that wasn’t the case. Hockey did get a soft launch early in the fall, but it was short-lived, as further restrictions would come down from the province. Central Alberta Hockey League and southern Alberta teams were able to get in a handful of games into November, but after the provincial government made the call to bring stricter measures back into place, it effectively stopped local hockey until the New Year. The biggest heartbreak across hockey was for graduating players who were not able to complete their minor hockey careers. “I hope there is a meaningful season after this break and our players get the opportunity to compete. It would be a shame if our third-year players did not get the opportunity to finish their minor hockey careers properly,” said Lynn Degenstein, head coach of the U18 Taber Golden Suns. Minor hockey associations also expressed their disappointment Grade 12 players did not have a chance to finish strong in their minor hockey careers. “For us, that’s probably been the most devastating thing. We have a number of kids in our association, and we merged with Picture Butte for our U18 group. So between Picture Butte and Coaldale minor hockey, we have several kids who are in their last year. I know a lot of kids came back this year to be able to play with their friends and have that last chance to play. Our association was hoping to bid on provincials this year for U18, like last year when we put in a bid. We feel bad for those kids. We do hope Hockey Alberta creates some opportunities for them to have another year of organized hockey, whether it’s a Junior C season or something. But that’s up to Hockey Alberta to decide,” stated Darren Hurt, Coaldale Minor Hockey president. Football was allowed to play games against teams in their own zone — which gave kids the chance to further develop their skills on the gridiron. And while it was far from a regular season, it was still an overall success considering the circumstances. “This was a season that required a lot more hoop-jumping than any other I’ve been involved in, but in the end, with the help of a fantastic group of volunteers, we were able to give the kids a chance to get out on the field and play,” said Jason Jensen, Taber Minor Football president. “With all they’ve been through with this pandemic, I think that was something that was dearly needed, and made all the hard work worth it. I’d call that a successful year.” Other sports last fall weren’t so lucky. School court sports, gymnastics and figure skating all saw difficulties in getting off the ground due to the pandemic. The lack of local sports has been devastating for kids who count down the days until their perspective sport rolls around and being cooped up for months in a row was not something anybody wanted. But during this time, it’s a great opportunity to reflect on how much local sports mean to small communities in southern Alberta. In Coaldale, the Copperheads mean so much to the community. Just walk into the Snakepit on a Saturday night and tell me the community doesn’t love that team. In Taber, football season is massive and the Ken McDonald Sports Complex is packed for W.R. Myers Rebels games every single game. And Vauxhall has the Academy Jets. Their home tournament near the end of the spring season sees tons of the community come out and support the team. It’s not just about having kids go out and play the game they love, it’s also about each community rallying around one team. And without that over the past several years, it feels like a piece is missing. Now, with restrictions starting to lift slightly and vaccines on the way, the hope to have sports back at the local level is starting to feel like it’s on the horizon. And when it does, don’t hesitate to get out there and support your local teams and athletes. I can guarantee they will be fired up to finally get out there and having the support of the community may be the highlight of many of their sporting careers.                      "

The first episode of the new series will air once again from the famous villa in Majorca and fans of the ITV2 show can't wait after it was put on hold last summer.  You can follow our Love Island blog for live updates here.  In a sneak preview the first 10 contestants will couple up and get cosy around the famous fire pit, but eagle-eyed viewers might notice that one cast member is missing. You can see the teaser for the first coupling as the girls fight over the boys here. Last week, Love Island announced the line-up of 11, including Chloe Burrows from Bicester.  However, in a first look at tonight's show Chloe is suspiciously missing, indicating that she may be the show's first bombshell.        Chloe Burrows, 25, is hoping to find romance after 'awful situationships'  (Image: ITV)   And now a teaser clip has confirmed as much, with Toby receiving a text from the late arrival.  In a a voice note, Chloe can be heard saying: ""Hey boys. How are you? Chloe here. I've just arrived and I'm outside the front of the Villa.  ""I'd like to take you all on a date but I’ll let you guys decide who wants to come and join me. Hopefully I’ll see you soon.""  But who is Chloe Burrows?  Chloe is a 25-year-old financial services marketing executive from Bicester.  She said her friends and family would describe her as ""funny"" and she's also looking for that in a partner.        Chloe arrives as a bombshell at the Villa.  (Image: ITV Pictures)   She said: ""I'm always the funny one in a situation. I always try and make everyone laugh. Outgoing, I'm quite bubbly and always doing something.""  When it comes to a partner, Chloe explained: ""I like a good build. I go to the gym. I want someone who is funny. Really funny and caring and will do nice little things for you. And then obviously someone who you can depend on to not ditch you. Because I am quite a big character and quite loud, they would have to be as loud, if not more. I could never be with someone who is quiet. Someone that gives you a bit back.""  When asked why she wanted to take part in the new series of Love Island, Chloe said: ""I've been in awful 'situationships' and stuff so I just thought, why not?!""

This time the garment was purple and from Gucci.  To complete her look for Archie's christening today Kate added a red headband by London milliner Juliette Botterill.  The christening comes as Meghan and Harry face continued and growing backlash surrounding the event, as they insisted it be kept private.   The service took place in a tiny chapel inside Windsor Castle, with many of the guests arriving discreetly by a back entrance to the grounds.   The royal couple have refused to reveal who their son's godparents are despite billing the public £2.4million for renovations to Frogmore cottage.   A handful of royals fans gathered in Windsor for the event and, though excited, some suggested they have been left 'disappointed' that the public will not get to see any of the private ceremony or find out who has been chosen as godparents.   Mystery surrounded the private event, with the royal couple refusing to allow media into the event, and using a royal loophole to avoid telling public who had been chosen as godparents.    Several experts suggested it was a disappointing move, and would upset those who loved the couple the most.    Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, suggested Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan Markle, 37, had 'really upset the people who loved them the most' with the move, telling the  Daily Express  Seward went on to reveal: 'The secrecy and evasiveness of the whole situation has been so mismanaged. It's a real shame.'   The date for Archie's christening had to be pushed back by two days, after his parents discovered that both the Queen and Prince Charles had prior engagements on the first date.  While the Queen has bowed out graciously in order to spend a long planned weekend with Prince Philip in Sandringham, after a family conference it was decided that the date should be moved to accommodate Prince Charles.  He was away in Wales on the previously planned date to celebrate 50 years of him being Prince of the country.   Photographer and former soldier Chris Allerton will capture shots of Archie's christening today, having previous taken private photographs for Meghan and Harry.  Allerton is said to have formed a close bond with the couple, having taken private pictures during Archie's photocall as well as the royal wedding.    He is said to have developed his first roll of film at just eight years old and according to his website 'has been hooked on photography since'.  Allerton left the British Army in 2001 and went on to Lichfield Studios in Notting Hill.   It was here that he learnt the skills needed to master professional photography.  He now travels all over the world and has clients such as Harpers Bazaar, Tatler and broadsheet newspapers.   After taking photos at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May last year, Allerton posted his thanks to the couple.  He said: 'It was a great honour to be asked to photograph The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding day in May. I am delighted that Their Highnesses chose this photograph for their Christmas card.'    Allerton had previous studies at the University of Reading, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Prior to that he attended the prestigious Stowe School in Buckinghamshire.  In 1992 he started his Army career and served there until 2001. During his time in the Army he worked for the Household Cavalry.  He was commissioned into The Life Guards, Household Cavalry, before serving in Bosnia in 1994 and Singapore and Argentina in 1995.  His last posting was in 1998 at the Adjutant New College at The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. He resigned commission in 2000.    In 2001 he started work as a photographic director for Photographic Records. He worked there for over two years.  He then decided to start his own company Allerton Photography, which has offices in both London and Wiltshire.    Although her majesty has not been able to attend all of her great-grandchildren's christenings, having missed Prince Louis's baptism last year, it is understood that she would have like to be present for Prince Harry's big celebration with his first child.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly shunned celebrities as godparents, instead turning to a close group of friends who played a key role at their wedding.   It has emerged in recent days that the couple are using a royal loophole to ensure baby Archie's godparents remain a secret.   Under Church of England rules, the details of all baptisms, including the baby's godparents, are a matter of public record and can be obtained easily for a small fee.  Royal sources have said that Meghan and Harry picked 'close and old friends' for the roles amid a backlash over the royal couple's refusal to identify them because they are 'private citizens'.       We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

It offers fairly traditional fare, but rugby fans flock in their droves and the atmosphere is hard to top: you'll find plenty of high spirits and match chats. There's often live music, too.  171 North End Rd, Fulham, W14 9NL Better looking than the usual sports bars, the Famous Three Kings boasts 16 screens and, though they're known for favouring the Welsh, they'll be screening every match of the tournament.  45 Kew Rd, Richmond, TW9 2NQ Scottish pubs are few and far between in the capital, so your best bet is to find an area where you're likely to bump into like-minded fans. The Orange Tree has two drop down screens inside, and a 65"" screen for those who fancy braving the outside patio terrace. They're big on food here, too, so make a day of it and eat. If you haven't been, be sure to see what's on at the Orange Tree Theatre next door, too.  19 Perth Rd, N4 3HB No prizes for guessing where this pub's allegiance lies, wandering into it's couldn't-be-more-Irish decor. Plenty of decent ales on tap, a surprising amount of space given how cosy it all feels, and a menu offering up Thai food for those who fancy it. And, with the likes of guitars, scarves, accordions and aeroplanes hanging from the ceiling, you can always play eye-spy, if the match is proving to be especially uneventful.  22 Frith St, W1D 4RF Another Soho favourite, this 24-hour cafe has long been a thriving hub, but it really packs out when Italy have a sporting fixture. The place may be a little too small to really watch the entire game, unless there are just a couple of you, but it's the go-to if you're wheeling around Soho and want to check in on the score. They do a decent coffee too, so it's always worth a visit between pubs whether you're paying any attention to the match or not.  226 Shoreditch High St, E1 6PJ Six screens will have every drop, tackle, scrum, maul and try in vivid detail as they show every single Six Nations match, with their food truck on hand to keep energy levels up. Naturally, there's plenty of craft beer kicking around in this east London hangout.  Greenwood, 170 Victoria Street, SW1E 5LB Victoria sports bar Greenwood is going all out for the Six Nations this year. As well as showing on their big screens downstairs, the bar is also hosting a luxurious Guinness lounge, where fans can enjoy a ‘stadium atmosphere’ and VIPs are served by their own personal bartender. If fans feel like enjoying an even more exclusive experience, the venue is offering the chance to enjoy lunch with rugby legends including Andy Goode, Stephen Ferris, Andy Powell and Jim Hamilton.  Ewan Munro  England open their account against France on Sunday, with the game kicking off at 3pm inside the Stade de France.  Our top pick:   This fantastic Irish bar from duo Aaron Wall and Ciarán Smith has some of the best Guinness in the city, and an exceptional cocktail menu to boot. As you’d expect, it’s popular with Irish fans on match days and the atmosphere is always a friendly one. The brunch menu runs from midday until 4pm on weekends too, so you can enjoy a full Irish while you’re watching the action. We love it.  Six Nations 2020  |  England Rugby  "

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said her office charged Sgt. Vadin Shyshimarin, 21, in the killing of an unarmed 62-year-old civilian who was gunned down while riding a bicycle in February, four days into the war. Shyshimarin, who served with a tank unit, was accused of firing through a car window on the man in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka. Venediktova said the soldier could get up to 15 years in prison. She did not say when the trial would start.       Venediktova’s office has said it has been investigating more than 10,700 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and has identified over 600 suspects. Many of the alleged atrocities came to light last month after Moscow’s forces aborted their bid to capture Kyiv and withdrew from around the capital, exposing mass graves and streets and yards strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha. Residents told of killings, burnings, rape, torture and dismemberment. Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Center for Civil Liberties said the Ukrainian human rights group will be closely following Shyshimarin’s trial to see if it is fair. “It’s very difficult to observe all the rules, norms and neutrality of the court proceedings in wartime,” he said. On the economic front, Ukraine shut down a pipeline that carries Russian gas across the country to homes and industries in Western Europe, marking the first time since the start of the war that Kyiv disrupted the flow westward of one of Moscow’s most lucrative exports. But the immediate effect is likely to be limited, in part because Russia can divert the gas to another pipeline and because Europe relies on a variety of suppliers.       Meanwhile, a Kremlin-installed politician in the southern Kherson region, site of the first major Ukrainian city to fall in the war, said officials there want Russian President Vladimir Putin to make Kherson a “proper region” of Russia — that is, annex it. “The city of Kherson is Russia,” Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration appointed by Moscow, told Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. That raised the possibility that the Kremlin would seek to break off another piece of Ukraine as it tries to salvage an invasion gone awry. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which borders the Kherson region, after a disputed referendum in 2014, a move denounced as illegal and rejected by most of the international community. Kherson, a Black Sea port of roughly 300,000, provides Crimea with access to fresh water and is seen as gateway to wider Russian control over southern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be “up to the residents of the Kherson region after all to decide whether such an appeal should be made or not.” He said any move to annex territory would have to be closely evaluated by legal experts to make sure it is “absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak mocked the notion of Kherson’s annexation, tweeting: “The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play.” Inside Kherson, people have taken to the streets to decry the Russian occupation. But a teacher who gave only her first name, Olga, for fear of Russian retaliation said such protests are impossible now because Moscow’s troops “kidnapped activists and citizens simply for wearing Ukrainian colors or ribbons.” She said “people are scared of talking openly outside their homes” and “everyone walks on the street quickly.” “All people in Kherson are waiting for our troops to come as soon as possible,” she added. “Nobody wants to live in Russia or join Russia.” On the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said a Russian rocket attack targeted an area around Zaporizhzhia, destroying unspecified infrastructure. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The southeastern city has been a refuge for civilians fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Russian forces continued to pound the steel plant that is the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, its defenders said. The Azov Regiment said on social media that Russian forces carried out 38 airstrikes in the previous 24 hours on the grounds of the Azovstal steelworks. The plant has sheltered hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians during a monthslong siege. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine has offered to release Russian prisoners of war if Russia will allow the badly injured fighters to be evacuated. An adviser to the Mariupol mayor said Russian forces have blocked all evacuation routes out of the city. Petro Andriushchenko said there are few apartment buildings fit to live in and little food or drinking water. He said some remaining residents are cooperating with occupying Russian forces in exchange for food. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested Tuesday that Ukraine’s military is gradually pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and a key to Russia’s offensive in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region whose capture the Kremlin says is its main objective. Ukraine is also targeting Russian air defenses and resupply vessels on Snake Island in the Black Sea in an effort to disrupt Moscow’s efforts to expand its control over the coastline, according to the British Ministry of Defense. Separately, Ukraine said it shot down a cruise missile targeting the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Elsewhere, the governor of a Russian region near Ukraine said at least one civilian was killed and six wounded by Ukrainian shelling in the village of Solokhi, near the border. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’s account couldn’t be independently verified, but he said the village will be evacuated. Ukraine’s natural gas pipeline operator said it moved to stop the flow of Russian gas through a compressor station in part of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists because enemy forces were interfering with the station’s operation and siphoning off gas. The hub handles about one-third of Russian gas passing through Ukraine to Western Europe. But analysts said much of the gas can be redirected through another pipeline from Russia that crosses Ukraine, and there were indications that was happening. In any case, Europe also gets natural gas from other pipelines and other countries. It was not clear whether Russia would take any immediate hit, since it has long-term contracts and other ways of transporting gas. Still, the cutoff underscored the broader risk to gas supplies from the war. “Yesterday’s decision is a small preview of what might happen if gas installations are hit by live fire and face the risk of extended downtimes,” said gas analyst Zongqiang Luo at Rystad Energy. In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of stealing Ukrainian grain and trying to sell it on global markets. The ministry estimates Russia may have already stolen up to 500,000 metric tons of grain valued at more than $100 million. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said a ban on sales of semiconductors and other technology to Russia by the West is limiting Russia’s ability to manufacture military equipment. Ukrainians who have found Russian equipment reported that it was “filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo said. ___ Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

He attempted to connect with wide receiver Joshua Palmer on a second-and-nine play at his own 36-yard line. Cowboys’ safety Israel Mukuamu intercepted the pass at his own 37 and raced out of bounds to celebrate with his teammates on the sideline. Uh-oh.       Would it be one of those nights for one of two Chargers’ quarterbacks vying to become Justin Herbert’s backup when the regular season begins Sept. 11? Stick got the start Saturday after coming off the bench to replace Chase Daniel in the Chargers’ loss last Saturday to the Rams. As it turned out, it was merely one play in an eventful half for the Chargers and for Stick, who made amends with an 18-yard touchdown pass play to Palmer in the second half that gave the Chargers an all-too-brief 10-7 lead en route to a 29-10 deficit by halftime. It wasn’t just the giant overhanging scoreboard that went haywire. By halftime, Stick completed 11 of 20 passes for 134 yards. He also was the Chargers’ leading rusher with two carries for 24 yards, including a 25-yard scramble on the final play of the first quarter, keeping alive a scoring drive that resulted in his screen pass to Palmer for a TD. Daniel replaced Stick to start the third quarter, with the Chargers in a deep hole, a reverse of their assignments against the Rams. They’re expected to split the quarterbacking duties again next Friday in the Chargers’ exhibition finale against the New Orleans Saints.       “I think he has a huge role on this football team,” Chargers coach Brandon Staley said of Stick in the early days of training camp. “I thought he had a huge role last year. Easton is really improving as a player and I can’t say that enough. I’m really proud of his progress as a passer. “I think everyone knew that he could make plays. Everyone knew that he had a lot of intangibles, a lot of quarterbacking stuff that way. … He’s going to have a big role. He and Chase play a big role with Justin, and we feel like our quarterback environment is a big edge for our team.” Stick had mixed results in the first half Saturday, though he wasn’t responsible for all of the Chargers’ halftime deficit. On the plus side, Stick and Palmer linked up for three passes converting 75 yards, including an 18-yard touchdown and a 41-yard gain on a first-quarter play. However, Stick wasn’t as sharp as he needed to be and, in the closing seconds of the half, he had the ball stripped from him by Dallas’ Trysten Hill, who recovered the fumble at the Chargers’ 15. Four plays later, Malik Davis scored on a one-yard run and the Cowboys’ lead was 29-10. The Chargers’ special teams had given up a 98-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and an 86-yard punt return for touchdowns by the Cowboys’ KaVontae Turpin, who was listed as the third returner on the Dallas depth chart. Mercifully, for Chargers fans, replays were unavailable because of a scoreboard outage. In addition, the Chargers gave up a two-yard TD run to Rico Dowdle, who carried 13 times for 44 yards in the first half. The scoreboard returned to life early in the third quarter, drawing a rousing ovation from the fans. Like the Chargers’ overall play, it wasn’t exactly flawless, with several large blocks malfunctioning at first before it finally returned to form midway through the third quarter.          "

The government through its subsidiary Pakistan LNG Terminal Limited (PLTL) had booked a maximum of 600mmcfd (million cubic feet per day) processing capacity of the PGPL terminal.  Last week, ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas firm, had  signed  an agreement with UGDC to supply LNG to the country’s transport sector. The LNG imported by ExxonMobil would now be stored and re-gasified at the PGPL terminal before flowing into the gas network under the country’s third party access (TPA) rules.  Trafigura and UGDC had reached an understanding on the cooperation agreement last year but could not actualise it for want of an LNG supply and import arrangement. With ExxonMobil’s commitment to supplying at least four LNG shipments a year, the two firms have now formalised the agreement for supply of 50-80mmcfd.  Singapore-based firm will use its surplus capacity at PGPL terminal for the purpose  “Trafigura has a long-standing presence in Pakistan and it owns the excess capacity, which is the capacity not contracted by PLTL, in the terminal of Pakistan Gas Port Consortium Limited (PGPC). Trafigura will use some of capacity to import LNG and sell gas to UGDC,” said a statement issued by UGDC.  The agreement was signed by UGDC Chief Executive Officer Ghiyas Abdullah Paracha and Fadi Mitri, Business Development and Origination, LNG and Gas, Trafigura. The officials of both companies and BW LNG Managing Director Yngvil Eriksson Asheim, whose company had provided the Floating Storage and Re-gasification Unit (FSRU) to the PGPL, were present.  Trafigura had been looking for private LNG customers to utilise its capacity for quite some time. UGDC and Trafigura have now formally entered into an agreement for a minimum supply of 50mmcfd of LNG on a “take or pay” basis.  Mr Paracha said the CNG (compressed natural gas) sector in Punjab was currently utilising about 65mmcfd of LNG and anticipated an increase in requirement to 80mmcfd in three to six months as supplies became predictable and touched 100mmcfd in about a year.  He said UGDC had now completed the supply chain for predictable LNG supplies to CNG stations and formally requested the petroleum division on Thursday to forward recent decisions of the federal cabinet to Sui gas companies for formal implementation of the TPA rules. He said the CNG sector had been a long-standing consumer of the gas network and also won the additional capacity allocations through a first come, first served basis.  Mr Paracha said the petroleum division was happy to note the LNG import and processing arrangements by UGDC with ExxonMobil and Trafigura because its vessels would be fully consumed in about two months that provided a cushion to the government to make up for any gap in its LNG imports, both in terms of storage capacity and utilisation of UGDC’s LNG quantities, in case of shortage.  He said the cooperation between Trafigura, UGDC and ExxonMobil was an example of how the private sector could effectively meet the needs of the gas sector in Pakistan, adding that according to the ECC decision of July 2019 and the cabinet decision of August 2019, the private sector could use additional private capacity of LNG terminals.  “This will help the government save foreign exchange and reduce the risk while encouraging the private sector and foreign investment,” he added.  Mr Paracha said UGDC would not only buy gas from Trafigura but also planned to import LNG from other sources with Trafigura’s support and welcomed the recent government decision to allow construction of five LNG terminals in the private sector to open up the sector to its full potential.  He said the arrangements were being put in place to ensure first shipment by the end of October or early November when domestic gas demand started to go up against declining supplies, adding that four cargoes would be available in the first year that would gradually increase overtime depending on revival of the CNG sector.  Mr Paracha said the agreement would enable CNG sale at least 30pc cheaper than petrol price. “Based on this price differential, we are hopeful that two million fresh vehicles will convert to CNG in two years,” he said, adding that this would result in an import bill saving of about $1 billion a year.  "

Get a bouffant,The bouffant is back!,arkansasonline.com,"                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The bouffant is back! The hairstyle, known for its round shape, with hair swept off the face and shellacked into place with quite a bit of hair spray, is symbolic of all that is retro. Think of Catherine Deneuve, Betty Draper in Mad Men and multiple first ladies (Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Jacqueline Kennedy). But the bouffant has made some notable appearances in fashion in the past month or so. Bella Hadid had one at the Marc Jacobs show in February. She wore a fitted black dress and white gloves, and her hair, styled by Guido Palau, was reminiscent of Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Kaia Gerber was given a similar hairstyle in a Loewe publication showcasing its spring 2020 womenswear, with hair sculpted into place by Simone Mason while posing in gowns on the grounds of the Isamu Noguchi Garden of Peace in Paris. For the February cover of Self Service magazine, blond model Rebecca Longendyke has hair styled by Duffy -- just one name -- with a few variations: wavy, messy, even short. The current CR Fashion Book with Kim Kardashian West, Naomi Campbell and Cher on alternate covers has the threesome posing as a biker gang in long brunette bouffants with bangs. ""The inspiration was the 1960s and Priscilla Presley,"" said Serena Radaelli, who did Cher's hair. ""Cher said, 'Excuse me, I was alive then,' and showed us photos of herself in the '60s. ""Big hair is fearless in a sense,"" Radaelli said. ""The modernity for this shoot was the length of the hair. It didn't actually take that long to do."" The unspoken message of the bouffant was always that it was high maintenance. ""They used to be this glaring symbol that you were a lady of the leisure class, right?"" said Stellene Volandes, editor-in-chief of Town & Country. ""They said, 'Yes, I have time to go to Kenneth and spend the afternoon there and have him tease my hair high and eat sandwiches from William Poll.'"" She was referring to hairdresser Kenneth Battelle, who was a master of the bouffant. Marilyn Monroe and Kennedy were clients. Volandes said she would send those curious about the bouffant to stylists who know their way around an uptown clientele: John Barrett, Valery Joseph, Julien Farel or Serge Normant -- or to Paul Podlucky's apartment salon on New York's East 67th Street for real Upper East Side verisimilitude. In short, it's rich lady hair, perfect for showing off jewelry. Hadid at Marc Jacobs was draped in diamonds. Or think of Kennedy at the state dinner for the Shah of Iran with a sunburst brooch from the London jeweler Wartski in her hair. Rachel Tashjian, 30, a style writer at GQ who occasionally wears her own platinum blond hair in a baby bouff, said that the bouffant looks back and forward. It's looking back at visual culture and trends of the 1960s and '70s and also taking note of bourgeois ideas around a lady of leisure. ""There is real emerging interest in the performance of getting dressed the way a woman without a job might have, the way dressing was described in Diana Vreeland's memoir,"" she said. Vreeland, an editor of Vogue in the 1960s, wore her jet-black hair pulled off her face into, yes, a bouffant, perhaps best to showcase her signature red blush. Yet what the bouffant also conveys is how we invest time on ourselves right now.

Now, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction  Israel's border fence with Syria, March 2019.  Gil Eliahu  Recent events on the Syrian border express what Military Intelligence has described over the past two months as the establishment of a new deterrent. Iran has decided to act against any attack it attributes to Israel, whether against Iran or organizations linked to it in the Middle East. At around 5 A.M., members of a Shi’ite militia fired four rockets from Syria into Israel in the northern Golan Heights; an Iron Dome battery intercepted all four and there were no injuries or damage.  skip - Haaretz Weekly Ep. 49  The rocket fire in September  was declared an Iranian response to an airstrike attributed to Israel against members of a Shi’ite militia in  near the Al-Bukamal border crossing with Syria. The airstrike happened at the end of August, after a day when airstrikes took place in Syria as well (near the Israeli border) and in Lebanon (in Dahiyeh, the Shi’ite neighborhood in south Beirut).  But in recent years, many attacks have been attributed to Israel and the Iranians responded in only a few cases. This time, according to intelligence, it can be assumed that Iran has a sweeping policy: Every action has a reaction. So what was the explanation for the rockets before dawn Tuesday?  As of now, things aren’t completely clear; both Israel and Iran have remained silent. On Monday, the Israeli intelligence company ImageSat released satellite photos documenting what it calls the rapid construction of an Iranian base near the Al-Bukamal crossing.  There are also reports in the Arab media, of questionable credibility, of an incident at the beginning of the week in which a convoy of Shi’ite militias was struck in the desert in eastern Syria west of Deir Ezzor.  A photo released by a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq after it launched an attack near the Syrian border, August 2019.  These incidents are happening against the backdrop of heightened preparedness by the Israeli military (which regularly moves Iron Dome batteries between southern and northern Israel), ongoing tension in  the Gaza Strip  (after the fighting with Islamic Jihad last week), intensive action by the Israel Air Force and a surprise drill declared Monday by the Northern Command. At the same time, Israel is in a political crisis as the time allotted to  Kahol Lavan chief Benny Gantz  to form a governing coalition draws to a close. This is a period when the dangers of mixing security and political considerations is higher than usual.  But apparently the most important regional development in recent days – and the competition is great – isn’t happening in Israel or Syria, but in Iran. Despite the regime’s harsh steps, above all cutting the country off from the Internet almost completely, the impression is that  the protests against the government  Reports by opposition activists and journalists coming indirectly to international media outlets reveal a major wave of violent demonstrations, organized attempts to use violence to suppress them, the deaths of dozens of protesters and a few members of the security forces, and methodical large-scale destruction of property. The real number of the injured or killed, like the exact scope of the demonstrations, is unclear.  Iranian-American journalist Farnaz Fassihi, who writes for The New York Times, tweeted on Monday night: “I’ve covered Iran for 25+ years. Never seen protests this brazen, this angry, this widespread. This is serious. That’s why there is a total Internet blackout. Regime is scared.” The protests in Iran broke out against the backdrop of the crises  in Iraq  and  Lebanon  , countries under strong Iranian influence.  In recent days, Arab newspapers have been covering their front pages with protests, incidents and mass-casualty disasters from Iran, Lebanon, Libya and Sudan. To some extent, these seem like a reincarnation of the Arab Spring, which was buried by the murderous civil wars that broke out in its wake. But this time, the main address for the protest in some of the countries is Iran, whose influence and power have grown, especially after the Assad regime's victory in Syria.  A gas station that was burned during protests following authorities' decision to raise gasoline prices, Tehran, November 17, 2019.  Abdolvahed Mirzazadeh / ISNA via AP  Ostensibly, recent developments in Iran should encourage Israel after a few months of the Iranians showing confidence and upping their provocations against the Gulf states and the United States. But officially, Jerusalem has been restrained in its public response. Perhaps more surprisingly, that has also been President Donald Trump’s response; in recent days he has been in no hurry to comment on Iran.  This is surprising because Trump has been harshly criticized, justifiably, for his inaction in the face of Iranian military operations. Now, when it seems that his sanctions policy is finally sparking a response in Iran, Trump is mired in political disputes at home.  Israeli defense officials have adamantly refused to predict what can be expected in Iran and are waiting for more information. Raz Zimmt, an expert on Iran at the Institute for National Security Studies,  has written on the think tank’s website  that right now there are no signs that the Iranian regime is in danger of collapse or is considering flexibility or giving in to Western demands regarding the nuclear agreement, despite the double pressure of protests and sanctions.  Zimmt is very cautious in his predictions; the regime in Tehran has been very effective in suppressing protests. But one lesson of the Arab Spring is the great difficulty in predicting the masses’ behavior during violent clashes and anticipating how protests will unfold.  Israel, by the way, didn’t have to wait for the Arab Spring to reach this conclusion. It learned this quite well during the first intifada, and to a lesser extent at the beginning of the second intifada.  "

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved. They must also not promote any commercial business, involve any person or organization that promotes hatred of any person or class of persons or otherwise involves illegal activity or contain any “inflammatory, obscene or libellous statement.”  In an emailed statement Monday, the city said the intent of  proclamations is to “celebrate and recognize organizations and events that are meaningful to our community and its residents.” Part of the evaluation process considers if the organization requesting the proclamation is local or has a provincial chapter, it continued.  A two-page city document that can be found online  regarding proclamation requests and the associated bylaw states the event being proclaimed must be relevant to Regina or Saskatchewan. The city was unable to provide any documentation that outlines criteria in further detail as of press time.  "

In sport, everything. From childhood, we come to see the head start in the playground race, the shove in the goalmouth, a rogue thumb on the egg (and spoon) as unjust, and quickly, loudly, “Oi!” object.The same sense of probity works its way up into professional sport. Sandpapering a cricket ball: not fair. Boxing with loaded gloves: not fair. Intentional misrepresentation in Paralympic classification: not fair. Colluding with betting syndicates to fix a result: not fair. Doping in sport: not fair.We classify our sports in order to pitch like against like and to keep people safe. Heavyweight boxers never fight flyweights. From puberty, the sexes compete separately in most sports most of the time. These are long accepted norms. Or were.Laurel Hubbard, 43, is poised to become the first transgender Olympian after being picked for New Zealand’s weightlifting team. Bubbling up to be one of Tokyo’s big stories, this fixes the spotlight on to whether trans women have an unfair advantage over biological women, and pits those sometimes friends, sometimes foes, inclusion and fairness.By conflating gender and sex, I would argue we fudge the very reason we have sex categories in sport: the male performance advantage. Without a separate category for females, there would be no women in Olympic finals. Even in the 100m, one of the events with the smallest performance gap, approximately 10,000 men worldwide have personal bests faster than the current Olympic female champion, Elaine Thompson-Herah (10.70sec). And it’s not just track and field. While the smallest attainment gap between the sexes comes in running, rowing and swimming events (11-13%), this moves up to 16%-22% in track cycling, and between 29% and 34% when it comes to bowling cricket balls and weightlifting. The difference in punch power between men and women is a whopping 162%. Not, then, to be sniffed at. But the International Olympic Committee tweaked its guidelines in 2015 to allow athletes such as Hubbard to compete in the women’s category, provided their total testosterone level in serum is kept below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months. Transgender men face no restrictions in the male category for obvious reasons.Increasingly, however, research is showing that these testosterone guidelines do not guarantee the “fair competition” the IOC was hoping for. Ross Tucker, a sports scientist and expert on testosterone advantage in sport, succinctly sums it up: “Lowering of testosterone is almost completely ineffective in taking away the biological differences between males and females.” There is just no proof that reducing testosterone takes away the advantage of muscle mass, strength, lean body mass, muscle size or bone density. Despite this new evidence from Drs Emma Hilton and Tommy Lundberg, the IOC has put off any further decisions making until after Tokyo and left it up to individual sports federations to decide their own transgender policies. Some have been bold, others have written their policies alongside trans lobby groups without consulting women’s organisations or sports scientists. Those questioning the narrative are accused of transphobia – as Martina Navratilova and Nicola Adams have discovered.The most common argument used in favour of inclusion is that sport is all about natural advantage and that being a trans woman is just another factor to add to the list alongside Michael Phelps’s size 14 feet and double-jointed ankles. The problem with this argument is that we don’t compete according to foot-size, but we do protect the integrity of women’s sport because the advantage gained from male puberty is so comprehensive in terms of speed, power, strength and so much else. Phelps’s feet gave him an advantage as a swimmer; male puberty gave him a much bigger advantage across the board. At the Beijing Olympics, he won the 200m freestyle in 1.42.96, breaking the world record. Federica Pellegrini broke the women’s world record at the same distance, finishing in 1.54.82 – a time that wouldn’t have got her into the men’s semi-finals. It wasn’t internalised misogyny slowing her down. Serena Williams told David Letterman that were she to play Andy Murray, “I would lose, 6-0, 6-0, in … maybe 10 minutes”. Male puberty and androgens give an advantage in a different stratosphere. Andy Murray and Serena Williams competing in mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 2019. Williams said Murray would beat her in ‘maybe 10 minutes’ if they played against each other in singles. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PASome claim that this debate is irrelevant as trans women aren’t winning everything, which is true. The simple explanation is that the athletes who have transitioned haven’t generally been good enough. As Tucker says, the best female cyclist will beat 99% of men, but the best men are 10-15% better. And anyway, regardless of whether trans women win or not – whether Hubbard wins or not – it is legitimate to question the rules that allow them in the competition, given the retained advantage. Given the safety issues in combat, collision and some team sports. Given the hidden exclusions, those women and girls who decide that a sport now isn’t for them. And the not so hidden ones: Kuinini “Nini” Manumua, the 21-year-old Tongan who would have gone to her first Olympics if Hubbard hadn’t been selected.The American cyclist Veronica Ivy (previously known as Rachel McKinnon) says hang the heartache, trans women are women and should simply be able to self-identify themselves into the women’s category at every level. This argument has got some traction. In which case, why bother having sex categories for sport at all? Just put everyone in together and watch biological males win the lot. I’d argue the opposite. The science is young. Stop. Breathe. Trans women should be able to live their sporting lives to the fullest so if research can find a way for them to participate in female sports without advantage, brilliant. Until then, remove the idea of gender altogether and revert to sex-based categories – a female category and an open category that can cater for trans men who have taken testosterone, trans women and men.But above all, there needs to be a realisation that you can’t always have it all. Just as women and trans men can’t dominate in men’s sports; and men can’t enter women’s sport; trans women shouldn’t be able to push open a door that was locked for a reason. It isn’t fair."

The work of 10-year-old Chung Anh shows how events unfolded globally, depicting the devastation with drawings of the coronavirus attacking landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, Big Ben and the Leaning Tower of Pisa as it spread through Europe, the United States and beyond. Her pictures also aim to highlight Vietnam’s success in containing the virus after a wave of imported infections, one with a virus-hit passenger plane in the arms of two soldiers and another showing the same flight intercepted by medical workers who spray disinfectant from fighter jets. They refer to the fated flight VN54 which brought in a fresh batch of infected people after Vietnam had declared itself virus-free for three weeks. The country has reported 332 cases and no deaths. Chung Anh drew herself in one picture about her safety to show appreciation for frontliners, who appear in most of her 11 drawings fighting the virus with shields or blasting it with disinfectant. “I drew this with hope that they can keep their spirits high to prevent an outbreak,” she said. “This girl is me, here I am drawing and these things are my imagination.” Several pictures feature the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship aboard which hundreds of passengers were infected, and Li Wenliang, the late Chinese doctor and one of the most visible figures of the pandemic, who was reprimanded when he issued early warning about the virus. Chung Anh’s mother, Doi Xuan Hieu, chose that as her favourite. “I was touched seeing that she can sympathise and acknowledge the sacrifice of the doctors who risked and lost their lives,” she said.

Schumer said Tuesday that lawmakers and the White House have reached a nearly $500 billion deal to replenish a small business lending program that had been overwhelmed with applicants impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The legislation would also boost spending on hospitals and testing. ‘We have a deal and I believe we’ll pass it today,’ Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on CNN. The legislation would come on top of a record $2 trillion coronavirus rescue law Congress passed late last month, which created a $349 billion small business forgivable loan program aimed at keeping workers on payroll. The small business initiative ran out of money last week amid overwhelming demand as the economy cratered and millions were laid off. However, a Senate GOP leadership aide cautioned that a deal was close but not yet completed as it awaited final sign-off from Republican leaders. The aide spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.”Dispute over corona testing said to be key - NYT: “A dispute between Democrats and the White House over how to handle coronavirus testing emerged on Monday as one of the most significant sticking points as negotiators struggled to finalize a nearly $500 billion bipartisan agreement to replenish a loan program for small businesses and provide more funding for hospitals and testing. Democrats are pushing to include a requirement in the measure, which is likely to include $25 billion for testing, that the Trump administration establish a national testing strategy, a move the president and Republicans have resisted, insisting on leaving those decisions to each state. The impasse hindering the latest round of federal aid to respond to the coronavirus pandemic reflects a broader disagreement over how to handle testing, a crucial element of the government response on which the Trump administration has been roundly criticized for falling short. President Trump and members of his team have boasted repeatedly about the amount of testing available and pressured governors to accelerate testing in their states.”House expected to vote on proxy voting, rule changes Thursday - Roll Call: “The House is expected to vote as soon as Thursday on a major, but temporary, change to the chamber's voting rules to allow for proxy voting as travel and large gatherings continue to pose public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. Lawmakers are expected to have to return to Washington this week to vote on an update to coronavirus pandemic aid for small businesses, and House leaders plan to use the session to also approve an emergency proxy-voting procedure in response to the health crisis. The change would allow an absent lawmaker to designate a colleague to vote on House floor matters on their behalf. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., announced late Monday night that if the Senate passes the small-business aid in their Tuesday pro forma session, the House could meet as soon as Thursday at 10 a.m., when a proxy-voting resolution may be brought for a vote.”THE RULEBOOK: NO MATTER HOW THIN YOU SLICE IT“The INFINITE DIVISIBILITY of matter, or, in other words, the INFINITE divisibility of a FINITE thing, extending even to the minutest atom, is a point agreed among geometricians, though not less incomprehensible to common-sense than any of those mysteries in religion, against which the batteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 31TIME OUT: BUMP IN THE NIGHTNature: “Gravitational-wave astronomers have for the first time detected a collision between two black holes of substantially different masses – opening up a new vista on astrophysics and on the physics of gravity. The event offers the first unmistakable evidence from these faint space-time ripples that at least one black hole was spinning before merging, giving astronomers rare insight into a key property of these dark objects. ‘It’s an exceptional event,’ said Maya Fishbach, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. Similar mergers on which data have been published all took place between black holes with roughly equal masses, so this new one dramatically upsets that pattern, she says. The collision was detected last year, and was unveiled on 18 April by Fishbach and her collaborators at a virtual meeting of the American Physical Society, held entirely online because of the coronavirus pandemic.”Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.SCOREBOARDTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCEAverage approval: 46 percentAverage disapproval: 49.2 percentNet Score: -3.2 pointsChange from one week ago: ↓ 0.2 points[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 49% approve - 49% disapprove; Monmouth University: 46% approve - 49% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 43% disapprove.] WANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?

The White House-driven initiative is expected to center on suspending federal regulations for small businesses and expanding an existing administration program that requires agencies to revoke two regulations for every new one they issue, the two people said. While the plan remains in flux, changes could affect environmental policy, labor policy, workplace safety and health care, among other areas. The White House is also likely to seek to make permanent some temporary regulations issued by agencies over the past few weeks to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.”Trump to bar foreign workers, a move he says will help economy - WSJ: “President Trump said he plans to sign an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the U.S., saying he was doing so to protect American jobs as the novel coronavirus has taken a sharp toll on the economy. ... Administration officials said the order wouldn’t make substantial changes to current U.S. policy. Even without an executive order, the administration has already all but ceased nearly every form of immigration. Most visa processing has been halted, meaning almost no one can apply for a visa to visit or move to the U.S. Visa interviews and citizenship ceremonies have been post­poned and the refugee program paused, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported. Migrants caught crossing the border are now immediately expelled once they are found.”MORE SOUTHERN STATES MOVE TO GRADUAL OPENINGNYT: “Residents of Georgia will be allowed on Friday to return to the gym and get haircuts, pedicures, massages and tattoos. Next Monday, they can dine again in restaurants and go to the movies. With that announcement, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia on Monday joined officials in other states who are moving ahead with plans to relax restrictions intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, despite signs that the outbreak is just beginning to strike some parts of the country. In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee said on Monday that he was not extending his “safer-at-home” order that is set to expire on April 30. … In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, said on Monday that department stores and some other retail businesses that had previously been deemed nonessential would be allowed to reopen on Tuesday, but they must abide by social distancing guidelines. People will also be able to gain access to public beaches on Tuesday.”Iowa deploys National Guard to help meatpackers - Bloomberg: “Hundreds of National Guard personnel are being activated in Iowa as coronavirus sweeps through meat-processing plants in a state that accounts for about a third of U.S. pork supply. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said 250 National Guard members have been moved to full-time federal duty status and could help with testing and contact tracing for workers at plants operated by Tyson Foods Inc. and National Beef Packing Co. Activating guard soldiers is the latest attempt to contain the disease, which has forced a growing number of slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants to slow or halt operations. The disruptions are stoking concerns for eventual fresh-meat shortages in grocery stores as well leaving some farmers without a market for their animals. That’s pushing down prices for hogs and cattle, while making meat more expensive. Wholesale pork posted its biggest three-day gain in six years.”Most Americans expect quarantine to last until summer - WaPo: “A majority say it could be June or later before it will be safe for larger gatherings to take place again, according to a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll. Most Americans – 54 percent – give the president negative marks for his handling of the outbreak in this country and offer mixed reviews for the federal government as a whole. By contrast, 72 percent of Americans give positive ratings to the governors of their states for the way they have dealt with the crisis, with workers also rating their employers positively.”BIDEN GETS MONEY BOOST BUT STILL TRAILS MASSIVELYNYT: “Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party could raise almost $1 million every single day between now and November, and he would still barely catch up to what President Trump and the Republican Party had in the bank at the start of April — let alone what Mr. Trump will have by Election Day. New fund-raising figures released late Monday show the depth of the financial hole in which Mr. Biden finds himself at the start of the general election campaign: The presumptive Democratic nominee and his party are nearly $187 million behind the Republican National Committee and Mr. Trump, who has spent the last three years stockpiling his huge war chest. The sheer size of Mr. Trump’s early advantage creates a unique set of financial and political pressures for Mr. Biden. He must find ways to both expand his appeal to small online contributors and attract huge seven- and eight-figure checks to the outside super PACs supporting him — all while sheltered in his Delaware home because of the coronavirus.”Lauds Michelle Obama but downplays veep talk - KDKA: “Joe Biden says he would take Michelle Obama to be his running mate for the 2020 presidential election. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee told KDKA’s Jon Delano that the former first lady would be a strong addition as VP if he thought she would accept the nomination. ‘I’d take her in a heartbeat,’ Biden said on Monday. ‘She’s brilliant. She knows the way around. She is a really fine woman. The Obamas are great friends.’ ‘I don’t think she has any desire to live near the White House again,’ Biden added. Biden did say it is still early in the process of selecting a vice president. ‘In terms of who to pick, we’re just beginning the process,’ Biden told KDKA. ‘We’ll shortly name the committee to review this and begin to look through the backgrounds of the various potential nominees. And that’s just getting underway.’”PLAY-BY-PLAYWhere’s the surgeon general? - PoliticoNetanyahu reaches power-sharing agreement - The Jerusalem PostAUDIBLE: SACKED“Our parks are closed down, so a lot of our parks staff, they patrol around just to make sure people aren't in there with contact sports and things.

Mayor Jane Castor talking about how the three-time NFL most valuable player who recently took $25 million a year to go to the long-suffering Buccaneers got booted from a city park.FROM THE BLEACHERS“Thank you Mr. Stirewalt for the excellent analysis of the recent events in Brazil. I am Brazilian by birth and American by choice. All my extended family is still there and subjected to the whims of a wannabe dictator. I have very strong (negative) feelings about populist governments, either catering to the right or to the left, North or South of the Equator. You can only imagine how it pains me to see the Republic there transformed into the bananas it is frequently thought to be. Thank you for your continuous centered reporting. As your other reader said, it is a highlight of my afternoons.” – Walter Bonomo, Mooresvile, N.C. [Ed. note: Well, we are very pleased to be part of your day, Mr. Bonomo! I’m also glad my try at international analysis passed muster with an expert. I didn’t want to bore readers who come here for domestic politics, but it can sometimes be helpful to Americans to look abroad and understand just how fortunate we are. We rightly bemoan the pernicious weakening of the institutions that protect our liberties in a republic and the bipartisan rise of enthusiastic numbskullism in American politics. But boy do we have it good here. We forget that Brazil, a country of 210 million people with the world’s 8th largest economy, only established its current federal republic in 1988. The guardrails against tyranny are weak to nonexistent. Americans can love, live, work, invest, build and create with confidence because our system is designed to keep men like Jair Bolsonaro, who are with us in every time, place and society, from becoming our oppressors. We have dallied with authoritarianism several times in our history, but our strong republican institutions have provided us time to think things through and (mostly) return to the wisdom of Mr. Madison’s marvelous machine. But as your fellow native Brazilian Paulo Coelho wrote: “Every blessing ignored becomes a curse.” I hope thinking about the plights of less fortunate nations will help us to not ignore our blessings. I will keep your family in my thoughts and prayers. Obrigado e que Deus abençoe.]  “Just finished ‘Front Row at the Trump Show’ by Jonathan Carl, a reporter who has covered Trump for 25 years. It seemed to me to be fairly even-handed and naturally concerned about a free press and preservation of the truth. Carl points out that Trump has always been a ‘serial exaggerator’ and that disregard for the truth comes from both extremes, even in the media. Here’s my question: What is the alternative to Trump in 2020? Joe Biden appears to be the Democratic nominee but what will be more revealing is who he chooses to be his vice-presidential nominee because that person - or an unelected chief of staff - will be in charge. I am a moderate/conservative mid-60’s retired Republican woman. There are very few choices this year (and in general) for someone like me. Further, I am convinced that there are MANY other voters like me on both sides of the aisle.” – Patricia Chartrand, Coeur d‘Alene, Idaho & Kailua-Kona, Hawaii [Ed. note: You’ve really plucked the tightrope Biden is walking with his campaign, Ms. Chartrand. There are lots and lots of Americans like you who might be very pleased to vote for a moderate, caretaker government led by Biden. He could send strong signals to these voters not just with a vice-presidential pick but by surrounding himself with surrogates and advisers who telegraph a message of competency and centrism. But he’s also got a party with a lot of upset radical members who feel that they got stuck with just what they didn’t want: a candidate just like the one who would appeal to moderate Republicans, independents, suburban families, etc. If Biden doesn’t smooch their backsides to a sufficient degree, not only might they stay home, but, more damaging, it would feed a narrative of Democratic disarray that would undercut the very concept of calm competency that Biden would be trying to portray. I’ll spare you my millionth jeremiad against the way our primary system works, but Biden certainly finds himself on a high wire without a net. The challenge for him is to time his pivot from party conciliation to electoral outreach. I haven’t yet finished Jon’s book, but I certainly agree that he’s made a sincere effort to write something balanced and thoughtful.] “Your comment in [Monday’s] Halftime Report rang a bell with me. I've long advocated putting our senators and representatives on per diem rather than a salary, the rate being set at a level sufficient to meet ordinary expenses - maybe equal to what federal employees receive when on temporary duty in DC. Couple that with your dormitory and maybe, just maybe, we could get 'em back to what the Founders envisioned:  citizen legislators who meet to do the public's business, then return home to their real jobs/professions. Yes, I know, there are many for whom this would represent a real hardship, but I can't believe that a salary in the neighborhood of $200K can be justified, given the general lack of productivity demonstrated by our self-anointed aristocracy.” – Bob Melson, El Paso, Texas [Ed. note: Very interesting, Mr. Melson! But there’s no perfect solution. If subsistence funds were all that the job provided we would doubtless see an increase in the practice in which businesses, public institutions and their influence peddlers provide make-work jobs for members of Congress and their spouses. That’s just one way that lawmakers can legally feather their nests while in office, so it is quite possible to keep a member of Congress on your payroll. But I’ve long ago given up on the idea of ever having an ethically pure legislature. Instead, I think we should focus on efforts toward transparency (full reporting of income, etc.), rules reform (smaller staff, more members, kick out cameras, dorm life) and maybe even a constitutional amendment for term limits. Whatever we do, American voters have a bipartisan interest in rescuing Congress from the hole it has dug for itself in the past 50 years.] “A number of years ago, I recommended that Bolling AFB become the required housing for Members of Congress and their families. Fashioning a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bath, kitchen, dining room, den and patio, with a security safe office only for the use of the member/senator, from the base housing, barracks and other structures would praise equality.  Trams or buses would run round the clock to deliver them to and from work. The Officers, NCO and enlisted clubs could be transitioned to nice restaurants and bars. The Commissary and Exchange would be transitioned to a reasonable grocery store and shopping plaza.  The gates would be guarded by capitol police and entry would be restricted to the families, approved staff members and pre-arranged guests. Do I really think any of this will be done. Not in my lifetime, but that does not necessarily make it a bad suggestion.” – Tom Winter Lt. Col. USMC (Ret), Steele, Mo. [Ed. note: Colonel, what you’ve described sounds almost like a minimum-security prison.

She had trained for five months leading up to the race’s postponement, the first in its 124-year history, and wasn’t ready to wait until the rescheduled date in September to cross the finish line. She had heard the requests to stay off the 26.2-mile course, but finishing that final stretch down Boylston Street was still on her mind. So, she got creative. …Devers designed a … route that began in the Boston Common and circled through the streets of Back Bay. The circuitous path ended at the marathon’s finish line and would spell, ‘Boston Strong,’ in her app’s GPS. Well, that was the plan at least. Once Devers checked her phone, she realized she had made a mistake… ‘Boston Strog,’ Devers laughed. ‘I’m an idiot.’ … Devers still plans to run the Boston Marathon in September as a member of the fundraising team for … a local non-profit…”AND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES…“And we should be encouraged to remember that the promiscuous dispensation of clemency is not a sign of political liberality. It is instead one of those valuable, identifying marks of tyranny.

In the digital age, love is just a tweet away! Oftentimes on Twitter, people find those who ‘get them’ forming meaningful bonds. In fact, people go on to share such stories on the service, recounting how they met on Twitter, with the hashtag #WeMetOnTwitter. It’s no surprise given that Twitter is the conversational layer of the internet and people come to the service to talk about what’s happening and connect with like-minded individuals. The conversation about #WeMetOnTwitter is steadily growing in India with 370 per cent more tweets about it in the last year (2021) than in 2020. Not only that, this year (2022) in just one month (January-February) we have seen the conversation increase by 28 per cent.    As they say one finds love in the rarest and unexpected of places, and sometimes a tweet is all it takes, let’s look at some of these epic love stories made on Twitter: That’s a catch! Sameer Allana (@HitmanCricket) a cricket enthusiast found his perfect match, Sana Shariff (@SanaShariffHai) a dentist, #OnlyOnTwitter    Love is love! Artist Sif (@sifofftherocker) met @sadboihoursonly on the service and to say that we absolutely love this tweet isn’t enough.     Manifest it into existence: Love really struck a chord with Kanupriya (@kanupriya) and Mohit (@HaramiParindey), and their love story is music to our ears.     Bigg Boss lovers unite: While #TejRan was the most talked-about couple and Tweeted hashtag this Bigg Boss season, Zain (@ZAIN17_) and Katha (@daffahojaosare) met on Twitter and fanned the flames of love outside the Bigg Boss house.    Love is patient, love is kind! Artist Ronin (@priyanthan_)’s love story stood the test of time and is aww-inducing.    Lastly, while love is in the air, remember that platonic love can prompt conversations and connections too. Through the power of conversations, Twitter has brought people closer and enabled connections and communities. With #WeMetOnTwitter we aim to find such stories of meaningful bonds, to be continued...

The AWBI has written to the district collector of Hyderabad and the Telangana State Animal Welfare Board asking them to conduct an enquiry into the death, reportedly after it was involved in a head-on collision during shooting of the movie.      The movie is being helmed by ace film-director Mani Ratnam and incident reportedly happened at a shooting on a private piece of land near a film studio in Hyderabad.The government body stepped into action following a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India that were based on whistle-blower reports of the incident. ""In the age of computer-generated imagery (CGI), production companies have no excuse for forcing exhausted horses to play at war until one of them drops dead,"" said PETA India Chief Advocacy Officer Khushboo Gupta. Compassionate, forward-thinking filmmakers would never dream of hauling sensitive animals to a chaotic movie set and forcing them to 'act'. PETA India is calling upon director Mani Ratnam to cut the cruelty and switch to modern and humane CGI and other visual-effects technology,"" she explained.The AWBI is the prescribed authority under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act, 1960, which authorises the use of animals in films. The AWBI also asked officials to ensure that the culprits receive ""exemplary punishment"" so that such crimes do not happen in the future.The Abdullapurmet police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against the management of Madras Talkies and the owner of the horse under Section 11 of the PCA Act, 1960, and Section 429 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. According to the FIR filed on August 18, the incident allegedly happened on August 11. It notes that the AWBI had given pre-shoot permission to the makers of the movie to use 80 horses in 'Ponniyin Selvan'. The horse owner is reported to have allowed producers of the film to keep using horses that were tired and dehydrated.PETA India is also offering a reward of Rs 25,000 for a video or photograph of the incident in which the horse died, which may lead to the culprits' arrests.

Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said her office charged Sgt. Vadin Shyshimarin, 21, in the killing of an unarmed 62-year-old civilian who was gunned down while riding a bicycle in February, four days into the war. Shyshimarin, who served with a tank unit, was accused of firing through a car window on the man in the northeastern village of Chupakhivka. Venediktova said the soldier could get up to 15 years in prison. She did not say when the trial would start.       Venediktova’s office has said it has been investigating more than 10,700 alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces and has identified over 600 suspects. Many of the alleged atrocities came to light last month after Moscow’s forces aborted their bid to capture Kyiv and withdrew from around the capital, exposing mass graves and streets and yards strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha. Residents told of killings, burnings, rape, torture and dismemberment. Volodymyr Yavorskyy of the Center for Civil Liberties said the Ukrainian human rights group will be closely following Shyshimarin’s trial to see if it is fair. “It’s very difficult to observe all the rules, norms and neutrality of the court proceedings in wartime,” he said. On the economic front, Ukraine shut down a pipeline that carries Russian gas across the country to homes and industries in Western Europe, marking the first time since the start of the war that Kyiv disrupted the flow westward of one of Moscow’s most lucrative exports. But the immediate effect is likely to be limited, in part because Russia can divert the gas to another pipeline and because Europe relies on a variety of suppliers.       Meanwhile, a Kremlin-installed politician in the southern Kherson region, site of the first major Ukrainian city to fall in the war, said officials there want Russian President Vladimir Putin to make Kherson a “proper region” of Russia — that is, annex it. “The city of Kherson is Russia,” Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the Kherson regional administration appointed by Moscow, told Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. That raised the possibility that the Kremlin would seek to break off another piece of Ukraine as it tries to salvage an invasion gone awry. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, which borders the Kherson region, after a disputed referendum in 2014, a move denounced as illegal and rejected by most of the international community. Kherson, a Black Sea port of roughly 300,000, provides Crimea with access to fresh water and is seen as gateway to wider Russian control over southern Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be “up to the residents of the Kherson region after all to decide whether such an appeal should be made or not.” He said any move to annex territory would have to be closely evaluated by legal experts to make sure it is “absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea.” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak mocked the notion of Kherson’s annexation, tweeting: “The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play.” Inside Kherson, people have taken to the streets to decry the Russian occupation. But a teacher who gave only her first name, Olga, for fear of Russian retaliation said such protests are impossible now because Moscow’s troops “kidnapped activists and citizens simply for wearing Ukrainian colors or ribbons.” She said “people are scared of talking openly outside their homes” and “everyone walks on the street quickly.” “All people in Kherson are waiting for our troops to come as soon as possible,” she added. “Nobody wants to live in Russia or join Russia.” On the battlefield, Ukrainian officials said a Russian rocket attack targeted an area around Zaporizhzhia, destroying unspecified infrastructure. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The southeastern city has been a refuge for civilians fleeing the devastated port city of Mariupol. Russian forces continued to pound the steel plant that is the last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, its defenders said. The Azov Regiment said on social media that Russian forces carried out 38 airstrikes in the previous 24 hours on the grounds of the Azovstal steelworks. The plant has sheltered hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians during a monthslong siege. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Ukraine has offered to release Russian prisoners of war if Russia will allow the badly injured fighters to be evacuated. An adviser to the Mariupol mayor said Russian forces have blocked all evacuation routes out of the city. Petro Andriushchenko said there are few apartment buildings fit to live in and little food or drinking water. He said some remaining residents are cooperating with occupying Russian forces in exchange for food. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested Tuesday that Ukraine’s military is gradually pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city and a key to Russia’s offensive in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region whose capture the Kremlin says is its main objective. Ukraine is also targeting Russian air defenses and resupply vessels on Snake Island in the Black Sea in an effort to disrupt Moscow’s efforts to expand its control over the coastline, according to the British Ministry of Defense. Separately, Ukraine said it shot down a cruise missile targeting the Black Sea port city of Odesa. Elsewhere, the governor of a Russian region near Ukraine said at least one civilian was killed and six wounded by Ukrainian shelling in the village of Solokhi, near the border. Belgorod Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov’s account couldn’t be independently verified, but he said the village will be evacuated. Ukraine’s natural gas pipeline operator said it moved to stop the flow of Russian gas through a compressor station in part of eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists because enemy forces were interfering with the station’s operation and siphoning off gas. The hub handles about one-third of Russian gas passing through Ukraine to Western Europe. But analysts said much of the gas can be redirected through another pipeline from Russia that crosses Ukraine, and there were indications that was happening. In any case, Europe also gets natural gas from other pipelines and other countries. It was not clear whether Russia would take any immediate hit, since it has long-term contracts and other ways of transporting gas. Still, the cutoff underscored the broader risk to gas supplies from the war. “Yesterday’s decision is a small preview of what might happen if gas installations are hit by live fire and face the risk of extended downtimes,” said gas analyst Zongqiang Luo at Rystad Energy. In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry accused Russia of stealing Ukrainian grain and trying to sell it on global markets. The ministry estimates Russia may have already stolen up to 500,000 metric tons of grain valued at more than $100 million. And U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said a ban on sales of semiconductors and other technology to Russia by the West is limiting Russia’s ability to manufacture military equipment. Ukrainians who have found Russian equipment reported that it was “filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators,” Raimondo said. ___ Gambrell reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

Die Regierungschefs der Autoländer sprechen darüber. Volkswagen hat sich vor den Beratungen der Ministerpräsidenten von Niedersachsen, Bayern und Baden-Württemberg über mögliche Auto-Kaufprämien in der Krise für eine weitreichende Förderung ausgesprochen.  Man werde sich dafür starkmachen, „dass die Politik Geld für diesen Impulsstoß bereitstellt“, erklärte VW-Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh am Mittwoch in einem Brief an die Mitarbeiter. „Wir wissen, dass wir damit nach Steuermitteln rufen“, heißt es in dem Schreiben, das der dpa vorliegt. „Aber wir wissen auch, dass sich dieses Geld für unsere gesamte Gesellschaft klug anlegen ließe und sich so gleich mehrfach rechnen könnte – nämlich ökonomisch, ökologisch und sozial.“ Generelle Kaufprämie oder Begrenzung auf E-Autos Die Regierungschefs der drei Autoländer – Stephan Weil (SPD), Markus Söder (CSU) und Winfried Kretschmann (Grüne) – wollen sich am Nachmittag zusammenschalten. Weil hatte am Montag zum Wiederanlauf des VW-Stammwerks Wolfsburg angekündigt, ein denkbares Prämienmodell zu prüfen: „Uns ist bewusst, dass wir eine schnelle Entscheidung brauchen.“ VW-Konzernchef Herbert Diess forderte „baldige kraftvolle Maßnahmen“. Söder sagte der „Süddeutschen Zeitung“: „Ich bin für eine sehr umfassende Strategie, wie wir der Automobilindustrie helfen.“ Nach den Vorstellungen des VW-Betriebsrats sollte ein Fördermodell unter anderem eine „Impuls-Prämie“ für Neuwagenkäufe inklusive Leasing umfassen, die auch für moderne Verbrenner gilt und über „einen klar begrenzten Zeitraum“ läuft. Sie sollte ähnlich hoch sein wie die „Abwrackprämie“ in der Finanzkrise 2009 und sich auch auf junge Gebrauchtwagen bis zum Alter von einem Jahr erstrecken. Abwrackprämie zusätzlich Zudem möchte Osterloh eine „zusätzliche Abwrackprämie obendrauf“, die es für verschrottete Altautos der Abgasnormen Euro-3 und Euro-4 gibt. Die deutschen Hersteller sollten sich nach Meinung von VW einig sein, die staatlichen Mittel „je nach zugesagter Summe womöglich sogar zu verdoppeln, zumindest aber die Wechselkosten zu übernehmen“. Daneben solle der CO2-Ausstoß als Bemessungsgrundlage für die Kfz-Steuer stärker berücksichtigt werden.  Söder hatte in der vergangenen Woche erklärt, er wolle sich mit seinen beiden Kollegen aus Hannover und Stuttgart zusammensetzen, um etwa über ökologische Prämienmodelle nachzudenken und gerade der neuen Generation von Motoren und Autos nach der Phase des Durchhaltens eine Möglichkeit zu geben. Die Autobauer hatten wegen des Nachfrageeinbruchs und unterbrochener Lieferketten ihre Werke über mehrere Wochen schließen müssen – drastische Umsatzrückgänge sind die Folge. Bundesumweltministerin Svenja Schulze (SPD) befürwortet neue Hilfen für die Autoindustrie, wenn sich die Förderung „auf klimaschonende Fahrzeuge“ konzentriert. (dpa)   Eine Buchempfehlung vom Verlag der Epoch Times Wenn der Staat eine aktive Rolle in der Wirtschaft spielt, hat jede Aktion einen Dominoeffekt auf den Markt. Neue Richtlinien und Gesetze können ganze Branchen verändern und viele Unternehmen und Investoren von den Entscheidungen der Regierung abhängig machen. Der Staat, der traditionell nur Gesetze verabschiedete und durchsetzte, ist dadurch ein führender Akteur in der Wirtschaft geworden.  Der Staat ist wie ein Schiedsrichter, der bei einem Fußballspiel auch noch zum Spieler wird: Er kontrolliert und reguliert das Kapital in einer Wirtschaft, die früher privat war und ersetzt damit die „unsichtbare Hand“ durch die „sichtbare Hand“. Es gibt mindestens zwei Hauptfolgen der umfangreichen staatlichen Eingriffe. Erstens erweitert sich die Macht des Staates hinsichtlich seiner Rolle und seines Umfangs. Regierungsbeamte entwickeln zunehmend Überheblichkeit hinsichtlich ihrer Fähigkeit, in die Wirtschaft einzugreifen und den Staat die Rolle des Retters spielen zu lassen. Auch nach der Bewältigung einer Krise behält die Regierung für gewöhnlich ihre erweiterten Befugnisse und Funktionen bei – wie im Kapitel 9 des Buches „Wie der Teufel die Welt beherrscht“ analysiert wird.  Zweitens führt der Interventionismus zu mehr Abhängigkeit von der Regierung. Wenn die Menschen auf Herausforderungen stoßen oder wenn der freie Markt nicht die Vorteile bieten kann, die sie sich wünschen, werden sie sich für mehr staatliche Eingriffe einsetzen, um ihre Forderungen erfüllt zu bekommen. Hier weitere Informationen und Leseproben.

Pictured: Karla wearing her old jeans 'I've always been the bigger friend but my diet began to spiral out of control within the last five years,' said Karla. 'Whilst working long hours, I opted for quick, fast food rather than cooking.'I would order excessive amounts for breakfast and lunch from Greggs and order a Chinese or Pizza of an evening.

Ajayi succeeds fellow co-founder Iyah Romm, who stepped down to focus on his mental health. The appointment marks a new chapter for the Brooklyn-based startup, which has raised almost $900 million since its formation in 2017 to serve publicly-insured, low-income patients. Cityblock now boasts more than 1,000 employees and is reportedly valued at nearly $6 billion. Ajayi faces the challenge of scaling a business that is focused on personalized, community-centered care—and, in doing so, proving whether scale and personalization are compatible. Cityblock operates in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Washington, D.C., and will expand into Ohio later this year, with more markets to come. What does personalized care mean to you? It means meeting people where they are and understanding that health care and health outcomes are not just a function of your diagnoses, lab tests or one organ system or the other. Understanding someone's mental health and social health and wellbeing is just as important, if not more important, than their physical health and wellbeing. You may have diabetes or high blood pressure or an autoimmune disease. There's research about what specific intervention medically we could use for each person, [but] what matters the most is that we understand how this is contextualized in your life. If you're hungry every day, if you don't have enough money to put food on the table, if you're super lonesome and struggling to feel connected — that matters just as much as the specific diagnoses that you have. We would be doing you a disservice by giving you exactly the same treatment plan as we give somebody who wasn't hungry or who wasn't lonely. We're recognizing the specific dimensions of each individual we serve. What is one question health care providers should be asking their patients? Can I have two? I've long believed that the answers to these two questions are actually really predictive of a person's overall needs and their outcomes. The first question is, ""Is there a single human being in the health care system that you know, and trust deeply, who would recognize you — and you would recognize them by name — if you saw them out of context? The other question I ask is, ""Is there a person in your personal life who you know deeply and trust, who you would entrust decision making to if you're unable to make decisions for yourself?"" When we discharge people from the hospital, many people run into trouble. That's why our readmission rates are so high. They can't remember what their medication list was. They were supposed to be taking insulin three times a day, but they don't have enough food to take with their medication. Who are they going to call? A big part of why Cityblock is so special is that we fill that gap. How do you build trust among patients who lost faith in the health care system or never had any to begin with? First of all, you show up with humility, and you show up recognizing that you have to earn that trust, that it's not going to be given to you. We ask questions, state our intent. You ask them for permission to learn more about what's going on. You show up and act like you care. You treat people with respect and with dignity, like you want to be treated or would want your loved one to be treated. You do what you say you're going to do. When you say you're going to show up, you show up. Folks who have lived experience, who come from the communities that we're serving, are often much better positioned to earn trust than a doctor in a white coat hammering on about clinical things. Showing up with a persona and orientation that's aligned around the member and their needs, wants and desires is really important. The other thing is being respectful but tenacious. You don't give up on people. We show up consistently, respectfully, tenaciously and continue to earn that relationship. New York's Medicaid program could see a lot of changes with the next budget. What do you think state lawmakers should do or not do? The core tenets that we continue to push for remain the same: integration of physical and behavioral health services on the Medicaid side and for people who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We push for a policy that expands and safeguards access to substance use treatment. We have benefited so much from partnerships with community-based providers, and this is where the opportunity is to augment the funding that community providers receive The evidence shows us over and over again that we can keep people out of the hospital if we provide them with person-centered, high quality, proactive, community-based care — if we strengthen the safety nets provided in the community around health and social services. —Maya Kaufman   Hackensack Meridian, Englewood merger dealt major blow in appeals court Hackensack Meridian Health's plan to acquire rival Englewood Health is all but dead after a federal appeals court indicated that it would run afoul of antitrust laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Tuesday upheld a decision to temporarily block the merger, after the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint alleging the deal was unlawful. The panel of three judges agreed that the deal likely would lessen competition in the New Jersey hospital market and drive up health care prices. Federal law prohibits mergers that might substantially lessen competition or create a monopoly. ""In recent years, Hackensack has acquired other health providers, each time raising prices at the acquired facility,"" the judges wrote in their decision, adding, ""Past behavior is often indicative of future behavior."" The New Jersey health systems signed the merger agreement in 2019. Hackensack Meridian—which, with 16 hospitals in its network, is the state's largest health system—pledged $439.5 million in capital investments over eight years as part of the deal. Representatives from both systems argued the merger would offer such benefits as upgrades and increased capacity limits at Englewood Hospital and the expansion of complex tertiary and quaternary care at Hackensack University Medical Center. Englewood Health operates a community hospital in Bergen County, where Hackensack runs two hospitals as well as a physician network and health foundation. The appeals court Tuesday countered that the ""claimed benefits were speculative or non-merger-specific"" and did not outweigh the merger's expected impact on prices. An expert for the FTC projected the hospitals would be able to increase prices by $31 million after the merger. ""Although this is not the decision we had hoped for, we entered merger planning from a position of strength,"" Englewood Health said in a statement. ""Englewood Health will continue to move forward with our strategic plan, enhancing our services and improving access for patients and communities across northern New Jersey."" Hackensack Meridian said it is weighing next steps. ""We firmly believe this merger is in the best interest of our patients and the community at large,"" the system said in a statement. The FTC's complaint against the proposed merger is slated for an administrative trial in 30 days. —M.K.   Midtown opioid nonprofit doles out $11M in grants The Foundation for Opioid Response Efforts on Tuesday announced the distribution of nearly $11 million in grants to nine organizations and universities across the country specializing in prevention, treatment, intervention and recovery. The Midtown-based, grant-making nonprofit funds organizations with resources to address the opioid crisis. During the past two years, FORE has awarded 64 grants totaling nearly $30 million for projects aimed at combating opioid use. Its latest $10.9 million outlay is the second largest since FORE was established in October 2018 and one that occurred after a lengthy request-for-proposal process. ""We received 400 applications from organizations across the country,"" said Dr. Karen Scott, FORE president. ""We're very excited about the nine we selected and announced today."" Many of the projects funded by the new grants target the adverse effect of opioid use on families and focus on treatment for children exposed to opioid use by their parents or caregivers. A $1.5 million grant to the Morgan County Partnership in West Virginia funds a community initiative to support children impacted by the opioid use of family members. A $439,547 grant to the Georgia Institute of Technology funds an investigation into the behavior outcomes of children exposed to parental opioid use. ""We don't want to create more silos with this work. We want to make it accessible and reach as many children and families as possible,"" Scott said. ""We look for how these interventions can be woven into places where children and families are right now."" A $1.48 million grant to the Denver Health and Hospital Foundation is designed to team with doctors and investigators to integrate an adult opioid treatment model—one already developed across the city's health care network—into a system for children and families. ""It will be working pediatric services into a comprehensive network of treatment that becomes family-based, rather than focused around the individuals,"" Scott said. FORE's grants are funded by the McKesson Corp., which donated them as a one-time gift to find opioid solutions. From 1999 to 2019 more than 500,000 Americans died from an overdose involving an opioid, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. —Brian Pascus   Pfizer to supply UNICEF with enough Covid treatment for 4 million people Pfizer will sell UNICEF up to 4 million treatment courses of its Covid-19 pill for distribution in 95 low- and middle-income countries, it announced Tuesday. The Midtown East drugmaker did not disclose financial terms of the deal but said it will supply the countries with Paxlovid doses at a not-for-profit price, pending local authorization or approval. Upper-middle-income countries included in the UNICEF deal will be subject to Pfizer's tiered pricing for the Covid treatment, the company said. The drugmaker previously agreed to sell 20 million treatment courses of Paxlovid to the U.S. government for about $529 each. Pfizer did not name the 95 countries but said the list includes all low- and lower-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa. ""Supplying to UNICEF is an important part of our comprehensive strategy to accelerate access to Paxlovid to treat Covid-19 infection as quickly as possible and at an affordable price in order to decrease the strain on health care systems and help save lives in low- and middle-income countries,"" Chairmand and CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. Paxlovid is administered as three tablets taken orally twice daily for five days. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December granted it an emergency-use authorization to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 in patients who are 12 or older and at high risk of developing severe symptoms. Between then and the end of the year, the treatment generated $76 million in U.S. sales for Pfizer. The company is now forecasting record revenue for this year. —M.K.

Photo: Fiji govt     The council's chief executive Vani Catanasiga said it would help stop more people from dying due to the virus. The call came amid a daily record 791 infections and three more deaths confirmed by health authorities for the latest 24-hour period. There are now over 6000 Covid-19-positive people in isolation with the death toll at 42, all but two of which are from the latest outbreak which started in April. Catanasiga said the health services and front-liners were overwhelmed ""and may not be able to cope much longer if the full capacity of the national humanitarian system is not activated as soon as possible"". ""FCOSS believes that activating DISMAC brings the full surge support currently missing from this incident management approach that Ministry of Health has been utilising since the beginning of the crisis,"" she said. Catanasiga said the health system had been severely impacted, affecting access to health services for the chronically-ill and other patients, including those requiring maternal health services. ""We have used the humanitarian system annually to respond to disasters that had similar impacts at the community level; this should compel leaders to consider using the system to stop more people from dying."" She said FCOSS had been collecting daily observations since the beginning of the crisis from its sub-national platforms. ""The situation on the ground is getting dire. People isolating at home and are unable to get support from the Health Ministry are now resorting to getting help from community volunteers, including for herbal remedies. ""We've also noted incidents of threats against families whose homes have been cordoned off because a family member is Covid-19 positive. ""FCOSS is urging the government to consider this option with urgency before systems collapse and more people lose their lives to Covid-19.""    Vani Catanasiga.  Photo: Supplied/FCOSS   Call to remove VAT on basic food items Meanwhile, Catanasiga is also calling on the government to scrap the value-added-tax (VAT) from basic food items. She said this was a key feature of the council's submission to the 2021-2022 National Budget consultation. The budget is expected to be revealed later this month. Catanasiga said the government must ensure VAT was removed so the hardship faced by communities with food security and hunger could be alleviated. ""This is no longer just a health crisis - this is a humanitarian crisis with far-reaching and long-term impacts on the well-being of Fijian citizens,"" she said. Catanasiga said access to food was one of the first challenges identified in the council's People's Livelihood Survey that was undertaken after the first wave of Covid-19 infections and in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April, 2020. ""The removal of VAT from basic food items, however, needs to be heeded this year as we anticipate that this health crisis will continue into the next few months. ""We've had two protests from communities in lockdown already in the last few weeks - much of it had to do with access to food. ""This should send a clear signal to the government that the removal of VAT from basic food items must be done in this year's budget."" Fiji has 6524 active cases in isolation from this latest outbreak that started in April.            "

Playing without All-Star slugger Aaron Judge and five of his teammates who also tested positive for COVID-19 recently, the Yankees won their second straight against rival Boston after dropping the first seven meetings this year. New York won two of three in a series originally set for four games before Thursday’s scheduled opener was postponed for testing and contact tracing. Boston, which has lost six of eight, left town with a half-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay, and seven in front of the fourth-place Yankees. Taillon (5-4) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings of four-hit ball in his 100th major league start, improving to 4-0 in his past five outings. Chad Green escaped a jam in the sixth to protect a three-run cushion.   Ryan LaMarre, just called up from the minors, added a two-run homer in the eighth — his first with the Yankees and first in the majors since September 2019. DJ LeMahieu extended his on-base streak to 30 games, longest in the big leagues this season, with a single that set up a third-inning run. New York’s no-name outfield of LaMarre, Greg Allen and Trey Amburgey began the night with 12 career home runs — fewest for a Bronx Bombers starting outfield trio since June 10, 1991. Not exactly Mantle, Maris and Berra — but not a problem on this night. Torres hit his fifth homer on an 0-2 pitch from Martín Pérez (7-6) leading off the second. Torres also homered his last time up Saturday night in a 3-1 victory that was called after six innings because of heavy rain. That gave him long balls in consecutive games for the first time since a three-game streak in June 2019. Odor reached on a bunt single leading off the fifth and scored on Greg Allen’s sacrifice fly. He added a two-run homer in the seventh to make it 5-0. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: 1B Christian Arroyo strained his left hamstring in the third when he went into a split stretching for a throw. He was replaced by Bobby Dalbec. It was the first career appearance at first base for Arroyo, who has played all the other infield positions. Before the game, manager Alex Cora said Arroyo had earned more playing time, and he and the team were comfortable with him at first base. … OF/1B Danny Santana (left quadriceps strain) is expected to come off the injured list Monday after finishing a rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Worcester. … All-Star SS Xander Bogaerts doubled twice after sitting out Saturday night with a sore left wrist. He was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth with Boston trailing 7-0. Yankees: RHP Luis Severino threw 30 pitches to hitters, simulating two innings. “I thought he threw the ball really well. Looks strong, healthy,” manager Aaron Boone said. Severino will likely face hitters again in five or six days before potentially beginning a minor league rehab assignment. He hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery, and his return was slowed because of a groin injured sustained June 12 in a rehab appearance. … Boone said RHP Darren O’Day’s season is likely over due to a left hamstring injury. … Boone said all six Yankees players who recently tested positive for the coronavirus are doing pretty well as far as symptoms are concerned. RHP Jonathan Loaisiga, one of those players on the COVID-19 injured list, was expected to fly to New York and rejoin the team by Tuesday, according to Boone. … RHP Michael King (bruised right middle finger) still feels discomfort and won’t throw for another five to seven days. … Amburgey exited after four innings with a right hamstring cramp and was replaced in the lineup by Brett Gardner. … A leaping LaMarre hit the right field wall with a loud thud trying to catch Christian Vázquez’s fifth-inning double and was shaken up. LaMarre was checked by Boone and two athletic trainers, but remained in the game. LaMarre was called up from Triple-A before the game to replace OF Tim Locastro, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a torn right ACL. UP NEXT Red Sox: Shuffle off to Buffalo for the opener of a three-game series Monday night against the division-rival Blue Jays. RHP Nick Pivetta (7-4, 4.30 ERA) faces Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (3-5, 4.34). Yankees: Following an off day, RHP Domingo Germán (4-5, 4.72 ERA) starts Tuesday night at home against Philadelphia RHP Aaron Nola (6-5, 4.53) in the opener of a two-game interleague series.

The Ministry’s Regional Engineer informed us that he is cognizant of the damage due to the rainy season, but notes however, only Casuarina Drive is under the ambit of the Ministry, and in 2019, 981 meters of asphaltic roadway was rehabilitated in Block 22 even though this section does not come under the Ministry’s purview. Further, the other areas highlighted are under the responsibility of the Regional Democratic Council. Presently, the Ministry only has one ongoing project in Region 10 on Bamia Road which is a rollover project from 2019.Additionally, all of the maintenance works finances have already been expended. Due to this, all works in Linden have ceased until a budget is finalised by the Government of Guyana through the Ministry of Finance.Though the Ministry understands the grievances of the people in the region and we empathise with you, we wish to reassure the residents that the areas under the purview of the Ministry will be placed as priority projects for 2020/2021 budget allocation.The Ministry of Public Infrastructure sincerely regrets any inconvenience caused at this time.Yours faithfully,Krest CummingsSenior Public Relations OfficerMinistry of Public InfrastructureCasuarina"

Photo: 123RF   Corrections told RNZ the man initially denied having any symptoms of Covid-19 when he arrived, but they were detected the following day. He tested positive today. The ministry said in a statement this evening that two of the three household members attend Mangatangi School on the Hauraki Plains. All three positive cases, and an accompanying adult caregiver, are being moved to a quarantine facility. ""At least one of the young people was symptomatic at school on Thursday. The school has been closed and parents have been contacted. Arrangements are being made for the students and their families to be tested,"" the ministry said. ""There are nine people in the household. Five others have tested negative and the ninth household member will be tested tomorrow."" The prisoner was released on e-monitored bail from Mt Eden Prison on 8 September to a residence in Firth of Thames, the ministry said. ""Electronic monitoring shows he remained at the property from when he arrived on 8 September until he self-reported to Police at the East Coast Road boundary checkpoint at Waharau Regional Park. He was held in custody in a cell on his own until his court appearance in the Manukau District Court on Friday, 17 September."" A pop-up testing centre will be set up tomorrow at the Wharewaka Marae in Whakatîwai. Ministry of Health is encouraging locals with symptoms to get tested.    Mt Eden prison  Photo: RNZ / Diego Opatowski   Director of Public Health Caroline McElnay said earlier today that the man had been travelling with one other person before he was taken to the prison. ""He is understood to have been in the Firth of Thames area before he was taken into custody, this is within the Counties Manukau DHB area, and is under alert level 4 restrictions,"" she said. Two new places of interest have been added to the Ministry of Health's tracing list in connection with the man, one in Mt Albert and one in Māngere. And the person he was travelling with is being tested today. ""Five corrections staff and six prisoners are close contacts of the man and are isolating."" After arriving at the prison, the man made a court appearance and shared a cell with another prisoner before the positive test result was returned. The national vice-president of the Corrections Association, Paul Dennehy, said it's not surprising there was a case at the prison. ""It's affecting New Zealand as a whole. This whole prison is just a microcosm of New Zealand society. ""And as a union, we're just supportive of all our members at sites across the country during this whole pandemic.""    Mt Eden prison  Photo: RNZ / Diego Opatowski   At today's media briefing, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was ""extraordinarily rigorous protocols"" that had led to the detection of the virus. Prisons are treated as a high risk residential environment, she said. All incoming prisoners are treated the same ""as any individual coming to our border"", and tested for Covid-19 on arrival, then retested up to day 12. New arrivals are kept in a separate area to other prisoners for 14 days, and all staff interacting with them wear full gowns safety glasses, gloves, and masks. The man on remand at the prison is one of the three as-yet unlinked cases from 24 new community cases announced today. However Ardern said as the man was ""essentially on parole"" his movements were ""very well known"". McElnay confirmed a tentative link to another case was known, and staff were working on confirming that, so it could be formally counted as a linked case. Both the man on remand who tested positive and his cell mate are now in a quarantined area within the prison. Both will be supervised by dedicated staff who are all fully vaccinated, wear full length PPE and will not be in contact with other prisoners, Ardern said. The four police staff exposed to the man are also isolating, three had been fully vaccinated and one has had one dose. ""Those who had contact with him will be regularly tested,"" she said. The prison's chief custodial officer Neil Beales said only essential staff have been on site since the man's arrival. ""Mt Eden Corrections Facility was our first prison to implement our smart-card proximity detection technology to assist with contact tracing. ""We have provided information to all of the prisoners impacted so they fully understand the controls we are putting in place for their health and safety. They will continue to have access to Health Services staff who will assist them with any questions or concerns."" Staff welfare provisions were also in place, he said. Ardern said prisoners were among Group 2 for vaccinations, because they lived in a residential environment. ""Auckland inmates have been among the first amongst inmates to be vaccinated."" Of the national prison population, 67 percent have had at least one dose. Beales said vaccinations weren't compulsory for Corrections staff or prisoners. ""Since the launch of our vaccination programme in May we have taken a proactive approach to strongly encourage everyone to be vaccinated against Covid-19.""              "

But internationally, human rights activists … see it as child abuse and human rights abuse full-stop,” she said.  According to the World Health Organization, FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women that reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women.  Portenier called Fougere a “forward-thinking person” who cares about human rights, considering he was the first Regina mayor to raise the pride flag. She hopes the city will reconsider the application in time for  International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation Day on Thursday.  Applications are approved or denied based on the criteria laid out by the city clerk’s office.  One of those criteria is that the group must be from within Canada in order for a proclamation to be considered and approved. They must also not promote any commercial business, involve any person or organization that promotes hatred of any person or class of persons or otherwise involves illegal activity or contain any “inflammatory, obscene or libellous statement.”  In an emailed statement Monday, the city said the intent of  proclamations is to “celebrate and recognize organizations and events that are meaningful to our community and its residents.” Part of the evaluation process considers if the organization requesting the proclamation is local or has a provincial chapter, it continued.  A two-page city document that can be found online  regarding proclamation requests and the associated bylaw states the event being proclaimed must be relevant to Regina or Saskatchewan. The city was unable to provide any documentation that outlines criteria in further detail as of press time.  "

This time the garment was purple and from Gucci.  To complete her look for Archie's christening today Kate added a red headband by London milliner Juliette Botterill.  The christening comes as Meghan and Harry face continued and growing backlash surrounding the event, as they insisted it be kept private.   The service took place in a tiny chapel inside Windsor Castle, with many of the guests arriving discreetly by a back entrance to the grounds.   The royal couple have refused to reveal who their son's godparents are despite billing the public £2.4million for renovations to Frogmore cottage.   A handful of royals fans gathered in Windsor for the event and, though excited, some suggested they have been left 'disappointed' that the public will not get to see any of the private ceremony or find out who has been chosen as godparents.   Mystery surrounded the private event, with the royal couple refusing to allow media into the event, and using a royal loophole to avoid telling public who had been chosen as godparents.    Several experts suggested it was a disappointing move, and would upset those who loved the couple the most.    Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, suggested Prince Harry, 34, and Meghan Markle, 37, had 'really upset the people who loved them the most' with the move, telling the  Daily Express  Seward went on to reveal: 'The secrecy and evasiveness of the whole situation has been so mismanaged. It's a real shame.'   The date for Archie's christening had to be pushed back by two days, after his parents discovered that both the Queen and Prince Charles had prior engagements on the first date.  While the Queen has bowed out graciously in order to spend a long planned weekend with Prince Philip in Sandringham, after a family conference it was decided that the date should be moved to accommodate Prince Charles.  He was away in Wales on the previously planned date to celebrate 50 years of him being Prince of the country.   Photographer and former soldier Chris Allerton will capture shots of Archie's christening today, having previous taken private photographs for Meghan and Harry.  Allerton is said to have formed a close bond with the couple, having taken private pictures during Archie's photocall as well as the royal wedding.    He is said to have developed his first roll of film at just eight years old and according to his website 'has been hooked on photography since'.  Allerton left the British Army in 2001 and went on to Lichfield Studios in Notting Hill.   It was here that he learnt the skills needed to master professional photography.  He now travels all over the world and has clients such as Harpers Bazaar, Tatler and broadsheet newspapers.   After taking photos at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May last year, Allerton posted his thanks to the couple.  He said: 'It was a great honour to be asked to photograph The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding day in May. I am delighted that Their Highnesses chose this photograph for their Christmas card.'    Allerton had previous studies at the University of Reading, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. Prior to that he attended the prestigious Stowe School in Buckinghamshire.  In 1992 he started his Army career and served there until 2001. During his time in the Army he worked for the Household Cavalry.  He was commissioned into The Life Guards, Household Cavalry, before serving in Bosnia in 1994 and Singapore and Argentina in 1995.  His last posting was in 1998 at the Adjutant New College at The Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst. He resigned commission in 2000.    In 2001 he started work as a photographic director for Photographic Records. He worked there for over two years.  He then decided to start his own company Allerton Photography, which has offices in both London and Wiltshire.    Although her majesty has not been able to attend all of her great-grandchildren's christenings, having missed Prince Louis's baptism last year, it is understood that she would have like to be present for Prince Harry's big celebration with his first child.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly shunned celebrities as godparents, instead turning to a close group of friends who played a key role at their wedding.   It has emerged in recent days that the couple are using a royal loophole to ensure baby Archie's godparents remain a secret.   Under Church of England rules, the details of all baptisms, including the baby's godparents, are a matter of public record and can be obtained easily for a small fee.  Royal sources have said that Meghan and Harry picked 'close and old friends' for the roles amid a backlash over the royal couple's refusal to identify them because they are 'private citizens'.       We will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The leaders of the powerful House Oversight and Homeland Security committees wrote a letter to Inspector General Joseph Cuffari on Monday, detailing the urgent need for interviews with his staff regarding new evidence of alleged efforts to cover up the erasure of Secret Service communications. “We are writing with grave new concerns over your lack of transparency and independence, which appear to be jeopardizing the integrity of a crucial investigation run by your office,” House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney and Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson wrote in the letter. They also renewed their calls for Cuffari to recuse himself from investigations of the erased texts. The committees said it has obtained evidence that shows the inspector general's office first learned of the missing Secret Service text messages, as part of its investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol, in May 2021. And that emails between top DHS IG officials show the agency decided to abandon efforts to recover those text messages in July 2021, nearly a year before they first informed Congress they were erased. “These documents raise troubling new concerns that your office not only failed to notify Congress for more than a year that critical evidence in this investigation was missing, but your senior staff deliberately chose not to pursue that evidence and then appear to have taken steps to cover up these failures,” the letter continued. Cuffari sent a letter to the two committees last month disclosing that Secret Service text messages sent and received around Jan. 6, 2021, were deleted despite requests from Congress and federal investigators that they be preserved. The deletion of the messages has raised the prospect of lost evidence that could shed further light on then-President Donald Trump’s actions during the insurrection, particularly after testimony about his confrontation with security as he tried to join supporters at the Capitol. Since that July 19 letter, a series of revelations about the Secret Service and DHS's mishandling of those communications have come to light, prompting a congressional probe into the matter. The letter Monday noted one email, dated July 27, 2021, where Thomas Kait, the deputy IG, wrote to Jim Crumpacker, a senior liaison official at DHS: “Jim, please use this email as a reference to our conversation where I said we no longer request phone records and text messages from the USSS (United States Secret Service) relating to the events on January 6th.” Lawmakers said they want to know why the watchdog officials chose “not to pursue critical information from the Secret Service at this point in this investigation,” and only decided to renew their request to DHS for certain text messages more than four months later, in December 2021. Lawmakers also revealed Monday that Ken Cuccinelli, who was DHS acting deputy secretary on Jan. 6, was using a personal phone at the time, but the inspector general did not report that fact to Congress. Cuccinelli's texts, along with those of then-acting Secretary Chad Wolf, have also been reportedly erased. The lawmakers demanded that the IG's office turn over by Aug. 8 all documents and communications related to the decision not to collect or recover any text messages and related to the deletion, erasure, unavailability, or recovery of text messages from the Secret Service, Wolf, and Cuccinelli. The committees also asked for the agency to make Kait and fellow deputy inspector general Kristen Fredricks available for transcribed interviews no later than Aug. 15.

Power customers $1.7B for Maritime Link,No description,cbc.ca,"Halifax-based utility Emera Inc. has been given ""final cost"" approval to recover $1.7 billion from Nova Scotia Power customers for the Maritime Link megaproject.  The overland and subsea transmission system was built to deliver hydroelectricity from the Muskrat Falls hydro project in Labrador across Newfoundland and under the Cabot Strait into Nova Scotia.  In a 94-page decision issued Wednesday, the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board said Emera subsidiary Nova Scotia Power Maritime Link prudently and effectively managed the project despite numerous setbacks, including the failures of two major contractors.  ""The planning and development of the Maritime Link Project was a significant endeavour. There have been numerous examples across North America of substantial cost overruns and construction delays of energy megaprojects,"" the board said in its decision.  ""The completion of the Maritime Link Project on time and on budget was a commendable achievement attributed to NSPML's actions throughout all phases of the project.""  35 years to repay Emera  Ratepayers in Nova Scotia will be paying down the $1.7-billion approved cost over 35 years, including a nine percent rate of return. In 2022, the bill amounts to $169 million  While electricity from Muskrat Falls, known as the Nova Scotia block, recently began flowing into the province at contracted levels, there have been lengthy delays in delivery from Newfoundland.  Emera's partner, Newfoundland and Labrador's Nalcor Energy, is years behind schedule and billions over budget with the Muskrat Falls project.  To protect Nova Scotia Power customers, starting in April the board ordered Emera to hold back $2 million per month it collects from ratepayers. If less than 90 percent of the Nova Scotia Block is delivered the money will be used to pay for replacement energy.  Lawyer Bill Mahody, representing Nova Scotia Power residential customers, said the holdback is an important protection.  ""In the event the energy is not received from Muskrat, Nova Scotia Power is likely to have to go out and replace that energy at additional costs. The $2-million amount on a monthly basis can be used to offset those costs and will not be paid by ratepayers,"" Mahody told CBC News.  Bonuses chopped  The regulator also disallowed some costs Emera wanted to charge ratepayers.  It disallowed 50 per cent, or $6 million, in executive bonuses, $300,000 in charitable donations unrelated to the project, $700,000 in above-market-price rent paid to another Emera subsidiary, and $500,000 in operating and maintenance costs.  In a statement Emera said it will satisfy all directives in decision.  ""We remain focused on working with Nalcor to ensure Nova Scotia customers continue to receive the full benefits of the Maritime Link project,"" the company said.  ""NSP Maritime Link committed to completing the Maritime Link project on time and on budget. The team delivered on that commitment, as the UARB has acknowledged in its decision today.""  How Emera jammed the regulator  The review board delivered a mixed verdict on the so-called ""acceleration agreement"" between Emera and Nalcor that triggered the flow of the Nova Scotia Block, allowing Emera to file its ""final cost"" application for the Maritime Link.  Not surprisingly, given the history of problems and delays, less than 20 percent of contracted amounts of Nova Scotia Block electricity were actually delivered between August 2021 and the regulatory hearing in December.  ""Had the Board known at the time the hearing was set down that only 19% of the energy would flow between August 15 and November 30, 2021, the Board would not have agreed to have the hearing at this time,"" the board wrote.  The Muskrat Falls hydro project has been years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over budget. (CBC)  However, the board sided with the company in its claim the acceleration agreement got hydro into Nova Scotia much faster than had it waited for final commissioning of the project.  That has been held up by software bugs in Nalcor's Labrador Island Link, a 1,100-kilometre high-voltage DC transmission line from Muskrat Falls in central Labrador, site of the 824-megawatt power-generating station, to Soldiers Pond on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula.  Final commissioning is not expected until the end of May at the earliest.  ""Moreover, the NS Block provides valuable renewable energy which counts towards NS Power's Renewable Electricity Standards requirements and addresses some of the Utility's [greenhouse gas] requirements, with potentially significant financial implications if not satisfied by the end of the current compliance period on December 31, 2022,"" the board wrote.  Project still needs tracking  The decision frequently refers to the lengthy delays in delivery of Muskrat Falls hydro, noting that Nova Scotia Power ""overpromised and under-delivered when they described benefits from the Maritime Link.""  And the board remains skeptical, despite praise for the management of the project itself. It ordered the company to continue filing quarterly reports.    ""It is clear that delivery of the expected energy and capacity via the Maritime Link has not materialized. It is also clear that delays continue to be experienced with commissioning the [Labrador Island Link].""  "

The chair umpire had to tell fans inside Arthur Ashe Stadium to settle down on several occasions when the Russian was at championship point. ""I don't think they were booing me,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.Medvedev convincingly beat Djokovic 6-4 6-4 6-4 to claim his first Grand Slam honour.The crowd at Flushing Meadows are known to create a raucous atmosphere during the major tournament and Medvedev produced three double faults as he tried to serve out for the title.""There were a lot of Serbian fans,"" said the 25-year-old. ""I didn't hear booing from my side, I heard screaming for Novak. ""Of course in those moments when I was doing second serves and double faults, it's not easy because that doesn't happen often, so you are not used to it. ""And it was the end of the match so I didn't feed off it. I didn't even think 'what should I do with it?'. I just knew I had to focus on myself, try to win the match, no matter if it's loud or if it's quiet, for or against me. ""My goal was to win the match and I'm happy that I managed to put everything aside and managed to do it.""World number two Medvedev has experienced an uneven relationship with US Open supporters, telling the crowd during his run to the final in 2019 that their boos had given him ""so much energy"". ""I'm willing to play any tournament in any part of the world,"" he said. ""Some they like me and in other places, like the US Open, they were booing me two years ago and then they were cheering for me in the final.  ""Sometimes I do mistakes, like everybody, but I'm doing mistakes because I'm being myself. ""I just take it easy [with the crowds] and just be myself. Not only with the crowds, but in life. I'm not trying to fake anything. ""If I would've thanked everyone from the start, when I was just a top 100 player, then maybe I would be more liked - but that's not my style. I just want to be myself and let people decided if they like me or not."" All eyes were on Djokovic, 34, in New York as the world number one was bidding to become the first man in more than 50 years to win all four tennis majors in the same year. He was also aiming to surpass the Grand Slam title tallies of tennis greats Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, with the trio all locked on 20 trophies each. ""I told him straight away at the net that I was sorry because I knew what he was going for,"" Medvedev added. ""And really, tennis is a brutal sport because there are two persons starting from the first round and only one can win - that's brutal, so, after the match I said sorry. ""He's a great champion and he congratulated me and for him, it was such a tough moment but to be honest, I never saw Novak not gracious after a defeat. That's why he is a true champion."""

No jewellery, no photographs, no clothes, no tools,” Mr Hassell said on Wednesday, as he returned to his property on Fords Road, about three and a half hours north of Sydney.  ""There's only one thing that didn't get burned - that’s my 1988 Bicentennial $5 coin.”  Peter Hassell's house at Rainbow Flat before it was destroyed by bushfires.  His two-storey, Spanish-red cottage with a wraparound wooden verandah was not insured.  For months, sheets of buckled corrugated iron have lain strewn across his property in a toxic rubble.  Semi-demolished brick walls bare the remnants of empty window frames, the fire’s radiant heat having liquefied the glass. Asbestos laces the ground.  But the long recovery process kicked off on Wednesday, with Mr Hassell’s property selected as the first site for the state government’s massive clean-up program, which is being led by engineering giant Laing O’Rourke.  Deputy Premier John Barilaro, the minister responsible for disaster recovery, said Laing O’Rourke and their subcontractors would clear around 40 destroyed properties at Rainbow Flat in the coming days.  “The sooner we can safely clear the 2,400 plus houses and thousands of other buildings that have been destroyed across the State, the sooner people can rebuild,” Mr Barilaro said.  ""Initial building assessments have already been done for over 41,000 properties. Now the clean-up resources are rolling out across the state.""  He acknowledged the slow start to the clean up process for north coast residents, many of whom have been living in temporary accommodation for months, after emergency services were forced to redirect their focus to the south coast bushfires which began on New Year’s Eve.  “I know for many here, in the north of the state, they felt that this is taken far too long ... if we could have done it faster we would have.”  “When you look at the final tally of the 2,500 homes lost something like 62 per cent of the homes lost are now in the south so they were significant fires.”  The NSW and federal government will jointly foot the bill for the clean up process, which is expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  NSW Police Assistant Commissioner and state recovery coordinator Mick Willing said the clean-up would be made challenging by hazardous materials such as asbestos, which may be present in as many as 40 per cent of the destroyed homes and buildings.  “This is a mammoth task and I ask people to please be patient for a little while longer, we are coming to your town as soon as possible,” Mr Willing said.  Laing O’Rourke managing director Cathal O’Rourke said the company was confident of meeting the deadline of having the bulk of the clean-up completed by June 30.  “We’re looking to get ramping up a mobilisation of about 20 teams on the ground, connecting with people day in day out from sometime early next month,” Mr O’Rourke said.  It will take two or three days to clean the debris and asbestos from Mr Hassell’s property.  "

The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which groups coastal countries from Australia to Kenya plus major fishing region the European Union, was convening virtually over five days to debate yellowfin tuna quotas.Environmentalists say the warm water species is at risk of depletion as over-fishing compounds other threats from climate change and pollution. There is corporate concern too: British supermarkets Tesco and Co-op and Belgian retailer Colruyt pledged last year to stop buying Indian Ocean yellowfin unless the U.N.-mandated commission adopts a plan to rebuild stocks.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has for nearly a decade had the species on its ""Red List"". Yet the total global catch has risen by about a third, to nearly 450,000 metric tons annually, according to the London-based Blue Marine Foundation advocacy group. It estimates yellowfin tuna stocks could ""collapse"" - meaning they would go beyond the minimum size needed for recovery - within the next five years if the catch is not cut.French and Spanish fishing fleets take the majority of fish, using industrial methods such as ""purse seine"" with huge nets that often net juvenile yellowfin yet to begin reproducing.'DELAY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC'Coastal nations want to limit Europe's distant-water fleets.Kenya and Sri Lanka, for example, want more curbs on devices such as fish aggregators: floating objects that attract tuna and other species towards nets.""They are the visitors,"" said Will McCallum, Head of Oceans at environmental group Greenpeace UK, of the European fleets. ""They are fishing at a far larger capacity than anybody else, and it's not an equitable state of affairs."" The Maldives wants the yellowfin catch to be cut by 15% from 2015 levels, when IOTC scientists first agreed they were being overfished. The IOTC had last year recommended cutting the catch by 20% from 2014 levels, but rowed back in January, saying that was distorted by projections from the 2018 stock assessment.Given that a new stock assessment will not be ready until the end of 2021, the commission may postpone new measures, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.""For a stock that is at risk of collapse, this delay could prove catastrophic,"" it said in a statement.The European Union proposes a total catch reduction from nearly 438,000 metric tons in 2019 to around 380,000.Demand for yellowfin is booming as its light meat is widely used for tinned fish and in sushi in North America, Europe and Asia. The global yellowfin market in 2018 was worth $15.8 billion, the second-highest value of the seven tuna species, according to a report by the world's largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL.Greenpeace's McCallum said the over-fishing issue had stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic and drastic action was needed now to avoid irrecoverable damage to the species.

Another 41% said that Trump should not be impeached and 15% said they 'don't know.'  Among Democrats, 74% said Trump should be impeached, up 8 points over the past week, while 13% of Republicans said they supported impeachment, up 3 points. It was unchanged among independents at 37%.  The American public has been increasingly focused on the question of impeachment following a whistleblower complaint about a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  The U.S. House of Representatives initiated an impeachment inquiry of Trump last week after a whistleblower report raised concerns that Trump tried to leverage nearly $400 million in U.S. aid in exchange for a political favor from Zelinskiy involving an investigation of Joe Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic presidential contender.  The poll of more than 2,200 U.S. adults found that 34% had heard 'a great deal' about the Ukraine scandal this week, about twice the number of people who had been paying close attention when compared with last week.   Another 30% said they have heard 'some' details about the Ukraine call.  When asked what they thought about the news, 43% said 'president Trump is trying to smear Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign,' up 4 points from last week.  The poll also found that 66% of American adults said any elected official 'should be removed' from office if they work with a foreign government to attack a political rival. That included 46% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats and about two-thirds of independents.  The fact that a smaller number of respondents - 45% - said that Trump should be impeached, however, suggests that many of them did not believe allegations against Trump or had yet to conclude Trump had indeed worked with Ukraine to damage Biden.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 2,234 adults, including 944 Democrats and 855 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.  Nancy Pelosi announcing a formal impeachment investigation is only the start of what will be an epic legal and constitutional clash.  Here is how impeachment goes from here.  1) Investigations step up  Six committees are now tasked by Pelosi with investigating Donald Trump with the intention of deciding whether he should be impeached. They are the House Judiciary, Oversight, Intelligence, Ways and Means, Financial Services and Foreign Affairs committees. All of them are now likely to issue a flurry of subpoenas which is certain to lead to a new:   2) Court battle over subpoenas - which could go to the Supreme Court  The Trump administration has so far resisted subpoenas by claiming executive privilege and is certain to continue to do so. Federal judges are already dealing with litigation over subpoenas for Trump's tax and financial records and many more cases are likely to follow. But the courts have never settled the limits of executive privilege and whether an impeachment inquiry effectively gives Congress more power to overcome it. If Trump fights as hard as he can, it is likely to make its way to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, expect:   3) More hearings  Democrats know they need to convince the public that Trump needs to be put on trial and the best way to do that is hearings like those which electrified the nation during Watergate. They botched the Mueller hearing but if they produce question and answer sessions with people from Trump-world which cause public outrage, they are on their way to:  4) Drawing up formal articles of impeachment in committee   The charge sheet for impeachment - the 'articles' - set out what Trump is formally accused of. It has no set format - it can be as long or as short as Congress decides. Three such set of articles have been drawn up - for Andrew Johnson on 1868, Richard Nixon in 1974, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Johnson's were the most extensive at 11, Nixon faced three, and Bill Clinton four but with a series of numbered charges in each article. Once drawn up, the judicial committee votes on them and if approved, sends them to the House for:  5) Full floor vote on impeachment  The constitution says the House needs a simple majority to proceed, but has to vote on each article. Nixon quit before such a vote so Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are the only precedent. The House passed two out of the three articles against Clinton and all 11 against Johnson. Passing even one article leads to:  6) Senate impeachment trial  Even if the Senate is clearly not in favor of removing the president, it has to stage a trial if the House votes for impeachment. The hearing is in not in front of the full Senate, but 'evidentiary committees' - in theory at least similar to the existing Senate committees. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides over it, but the procedures are set by senators. Members of the House prosecute Trump as 'managers,' bringing witnesses and presenting evidence to set out their case against the president. The president can defend himself, or, as Clinton did, use attorneys to cross-examine the witnesses. The committee or committees report to the full Senate. Then it can debate in public or deliberate in private on the guilt or innocence of the president. It holds a single open floor vote which will deliver:  7) The verdict  Impeachment must be by two-thirds of the Senate. Voting for impeachment on any one article is good enough to remove the president from office. There is no appeal.   Rihanna appears to have lost weight as she has to pull up her jeans when exiting a car... in her first appearance since Aaron Carter's tattoo tribute  Meghan Markle's best friend Misha Nonoo shares stunning first images of herself in the 'one of a kind' lace bridal gown she designed for her wedding to Mikey Hess  'Once she got her greenlight she didn't have to play nice': Wendy Williams is 'struggling to book high profile guests' as insiders say she's back to her 'mean girl ways'   Simon Cowell displays his lithe physique while soaking up the sun in Mexico with girlfriend Lauren Silverman and their son Eric, five, after shedding 20lbs  Eva Longoria spices up a chic python print ensemble with fuchsia stilettos and a coordinating clutch as she attends Sotheby's 275th anniversary bash  Justin Bieber and wife Hailey hold screening of The Notebook as well as time at the shooting range for guests ahead of their second wedding in South Carolina  Fit for a prince!

Article content I, like many other Ontarians, am in receipt this month, of a form letter from Service Ontario, indicating that, among other options, the licence plate sticker for my automobile was due for renewal. A bold portion of the letter indicates that due to public health requirements, online services are available.  Being somewhat familiar with online services, as most people have become since the COVID-19 pandemic began, I began the process of “online renewal.” After a brief wait to access the website, I entered all of the required data, then my credit card details, finally tapping the “pay now” button on the screen. After several days of not having been issued a receipt and then seeing the “pending payment” disappear from my credit card transaction list, I called Service Ontario to inquire about my renewal. After a brief wait, I was able to speak to a customer service representative who was able to access the “data.” I was then politely informed that since I was using a “mobile” device (in my case, an iPad) that my transaction could not be completed.

( Doug ) Paine, Greely Where’s the Bill 21 justice? Long, long ago, at a rally in Orleans, during his campaign for leadership of the federal Liberal party I asked Justin Trudeau at an open mic about the state of his father Pierre’s dream of “a just society.” In carefully answering he mentioned that his name was in fact chosen to relate the term “justice.” Justice indeed! Our current Prime Minister’s cowardice in the Quebec hijab debate shows us that his apple has sadly fallen well away from that tree of dreams and is rolling down a Gatineau hill gaining speed.

Thomas Brawn, Orleans Canada’s energy regulator should in Canadians’ interest Re: Oil output to peak 7 years sooner than predicted, regulator says (Dec. 10) The Canadian Energy Regular (CER) just released a forecast that oil output in Canada will continue to rise to 5.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2032 and then slowly decline by 17 per cent to 4.8 million bpd by 2050. This forecast is outrageously inconsistent with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change Canada signed, COP 26 agreements and stated Canadian government policies. Clearly CER is just a promoter of the fossil fuel industry and does not in any way take into consideration the interests of the Canadian people. The whole organization needs to be reorganized and staffed with people that accept both the climate change crisis and the government’s policies to address it.    Advertisement       This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.         Article content It is dangerous to have government bodies such as CER continue to project levels of fossil fuel use which would be catastrophic to the world — it only encourages the expansion of fossil fuel production. This would be a disaster for Canada – either the world moves off fossil fuel dependence and we are left with billions of dollars of stranded assets, or fossil fuel use remains high and the ravages of climate change inflict untold suffering and economic damages. The recent heat wave, wildfires and floods in BC are just a prelude of what is to come if fossil fuel use continues as CER forecasts.

All I can say is nothing I can say or do can take back the lost lives, the lost time spent with loved ones that he describes. I’m deeply, deeply sorry for that.”Last week Sky News presenter Trevor Phillips recalled his daughter’s recent death and funeral when questioning a cabinet minister over the hypocrisy of Matt Hancock and the rule breach which saw him lose his job as health secretary.He asked why more of his family members could not be graveside at his daughter’s burial less than a week after CCTV footage showed Mr Hancock kissing his aide."

Under the order's conditions, renters must sign a declaration that they make less than $99,000 a year, or twice that amount if filing a joint tax return.The order ""does not relieve any individual of any obligation to pay rent, make a housing payment, or comply with any other obligation that the individual may have under a tenancy, lease, or similar contract,"" according to the CDC's order.Landlords can continue to collect ""fees, penalties or interest as a result of the failure to pay rent or other housing payment on a timely basis, under the terms of any applicable contract,"" according to the order.The order expires on 31 December.As many as 40m people in the US could be at risk of eviction, according to the Aspen Institute, while nearly half of all renters in the US are cost-burdened, or paying more than 30 per cent of their income on housing costs.Protests across the US led by renters, tenant organisations and housing groups have demanded local and federal governments ""cancel rent"" and extend eviction moratoriums.""A uniform, national moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent is long overdue and badly needed,"" the National Low Income Housing Coalition said in a statement. ""The very least the federal government ought to do is assure each of us that we won't lose our homes in the middle of a global pandemic: the administration's action would do so and will provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.""The organisation said that while the""eviction moratorium is an essential step,"" it is merely a ""half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off of when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed,"" according to the organisation.""This action delays but does not prevent evictions,"" the statement said.The order follows a series of executive orders from Donald Trump, sidestepping Congress after it failed to extend federal unemployment benefits that expired at the end of July, as locally issued moratoriums on eviction proceedings were lifted and courts reopened their dockets.But the president's order did not immediately halt evictions, despite his emphatic claims last month that renters are ""not going to be evicted"" because of his order.""We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen,"" he said last month. ""We're not going to evict people ... We are not letting people be evicted.""His order, signed on 8 August, directed federal agencies to ""consider"" whether halting evictions are necessary as a health precaution during the pandemic.House Democrats passed two measures with up to $100 billion for rental assistance, but the Republican-dominated Senate has not agreed to take up the legislation.The National Low Income Housing Coalition has urged the president to work with Congress to put in place a national moratorium on all evictions with at least $100 billion in emergency rental assistance and housing vouchers, and another $11.5 billion for emergency resources for people experiencing homelessness.""Without a significant and sustained federal intervention, America will experience an increase in homelessness the likes of which we haven't seen since the Great Depression,"" the organisation's president Diane Yentel said. ""Allowing tens of millions of people to lose their homes during a pandemic is cruel and senseless."""

The sharing of pornographic material is also punishable with prison time and hefty fines under the country’s laws, which are based on Islamic law, or Shariah.Late on Saturday, videos and photographs depicting over a dozen naked women, lined up on a balcony while being filmed in Dubai’s upscale Marina neighborhood in broad daylight, splashed across social media. It came as a shock in the federation of seven Arab sheikhdoms, where tamer behavior, like kissing in public or drinking alcohol without a license, has landed people in jail. State-linked newspaper The National reported it appeared to be a “publicity stunt,” without elaborating. Dubai police said those arrested over the “indecent” video had been referred to the public prosecution.“Such unacceptable behaviors,” the police statement said, “do not reflect the values and ethics of Emirati society.”The UAE, while liberal in many regards compared to its Middle Eastern neighbors, has strict laws governing expression. People have been jailed for their comments and videos online. The country’s majority state-owned telecom companies block access to major pornographic websites. "

Об этом сообщают в Запорожской облгосадминистрации. «В этом году организация детского оздоровления еще не разрешена. Однако некоторые предприятия оказывают услуги по оздоровлению детей. Подчеркиваю, что санитарные требования для оздоровления детей и отдыха взрослых разные. По предварительным данным, отдыхающие отравились окрошкой. Окрошка — это блюдо без термической обработки продуктов, которое по санитарным нормам нельзя давать детям. Продолжается внеплановая проверка этого заведения, возбуждено уголовное дело», — отметил директор Запорожского областного лабораторного центра Минздрава Александр Мащак.  Также сообщается, что в больницу попало 13 отдыхающих — 8 детей и 5 взрослых. Они находятся на стационарном лечении и имеют среднюю степень тяжести кишечного отравления.  Местные власти решили в ближайшее время провести внеплановые проверки всех баз отдыха на Азовском побережье.  Как ранее сообщали «ФАКТЫ», отдыхающие на базе в Кирилловке начали жаловаться на плохое самочувствие вечером 1 июля после приема пищи. 64 Читайте нас в Telegram-канале, Facebook и Twitter     "

The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which groups coastal countries from Australia to Kenya plus major fishing region the European Union, was convening virtually over five days to debate yellowfin tuna quotas.Environmentalists say the warm water species is at risk of depletion as over-fishing compounds other threats from climate change and pollution. There is corporate concern too: British supermarkets Tesco and Co-op and Belgian retailer Colruyt pledged last year to stop buying Indian Ocean yellowfin unless the U.N.-mandated commission adopts a plan to rebuild stocks.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has for nearly a decade had the species on its ""Red List"". Yet the total global catch has risen by about a third, to nearly 450,000 metric tons annually, according to the London-based Blue Marine Foundation advocacy group. It estimates yellowfin tuna stocks could ""collapse"" - meaning they would go beyond the minimum size needed for recovery - within the next five years if the catch is not cut.French and Spanish fishing fleets take the majority of fish, using industrial methods such as ""purse seine"" with huge nets that often net juvenile yellowfin yet to begin reproducing.'DELAY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC'Coastal nations want to limit Europe's distant-water fleets.Kenya and Sri Lanka, for example, want more curbs on devices such as fish aggregators: floating objects that attract tuna and other species towards nets.""They are the visitors,"" said Will McCallum, Head of Oceans at environmental group Greenpeace UK, of the European fleets. ""They are fishing at a far larger capacity than anybody else, and it's not an equitable state of affairs."" The Maldives wants the yellowfin catch to be cut by 15% from 2015 levels, when IOTC scientists first agreed they were being overfished. The IOTC had last year recommended cutting the catch by 20% from 2014 levels, but rowed back in January, saying that was distorted by projections from the 2018 stock assessment.Given that a new stock assessment will not be ready until the end of 2021, the commission may postpone new measures, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.""For a stock that is at risk of collapse, this delay could prove catastrophic,"" it said in a statement.The European Union proposes a total catch reduction from nearly 438,000 metric tons in 2019 to around 380,000.Demand for yellowfin is booming as its light meat is widely used for tinned fish and in sushi in North America, Europe and Asia. The global yellowfin market in 2018 was worth $15.8 billion, the second-highest value of the seven tuna species, according to a report by the world's largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL.Greenpeace's McCallum said the over-fishing issue had stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic and drastic action was needed now to avoid irrecoverable damage to the species.

No jewellery, no photographs, no clothes, no tools,” Mr Hassell said on Wednesday, as he returned to his property on Fords Road, about three and a half hours north of Sydney.  ""There's only one thing that didn't get burned - that’s my 1988 Bicentennial $5 coin.”  Peter Hassell's house at Rainbow Flat before it was destroyed by bushfires.  His two-storey, Spanish-red cottage with a wraparound wooden verandah was not insured.  For months, sheets of buckled corrugated iron have lain strewn across his property in a toxic rubble.  Semi-demolished brick walls bare the remnants of empty window frames, the fire’s radiant heat having liquefied the glass. Asbestos laces the ground.  But the long recovery process kicked off on Wednesday, with Mr Hassell’s property selected as the first site for the state government’s massive clean-up program, which is being led by engineering giant Laing O’Rourke.  Deputy Premier John Barilaro, the minister responsible for disaster recovery, said Laing O’Rourke and their subcontractors would clear around 40 destroyed properties at Rainbow Flat in the coming days.  “The sooner we can safely clear the 2,400 plus houses and thousands of other buildings that have been destroyed across the State, the sooner people can rebuild,” Mr Barilaro said.  ""Initial building assessments have already been done for over 41,000 properties. Now the clean-up resources are rolling out across the state.""  He acknowledged the slow start to the clean up process for north coast residents, many of whom have been living in temporary accommodation for months, after emergency services were forced to redirect their focus to the south coast bushfires which began on New Year’s Eve.  “I know for many here, in the north of the state, they felt that this is taken far too long ... if we could have done it faster we would have.”  “When you look at the final tally of the 2,500 homes lost something like 62 per cent of the homes lost are now in the south so they were significant fires.”  The NSW and federal government will jointly foot the bill for the clean up process, which is expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  NSW Police Assistant Commissioner and state recovery coordinator Mick Willing said the clean-up would be made challenging by hazardous materials such as asbestos, which may be present in as many as 40 per cent of the destroyed homes and buildings.  “This is a mammoth task and I ask people to please be patient for a little while longer, we are coming to your town as soon as possible,” Mr Willing said.  Laing O’Rourke managing director Cathal O’Rourke said the company was confident of meeting the deadline of having the bulk of the clean-up completed by June 30.  “We’re looking to get ramping up a mobilisation of about 20 teams on the ground, connecting with people day in day out from sometime early next month,” Mr O’Rourke said.  It will take two or three days to clean the debris and asbestos from Mr Hassell’s property.  "

Bottom-of-the-table United have two points after 17 games, but Wilder has been in a similar situation before during the 1990-91 term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Under the stewardship of Dave Bassett, the newly-promoted Blades started life in the top flight with no victory from their first 16 fixtures, but once they got off the mark the shackles were off and they eventually finished in 13th position to stay up comfortably.                                                                                                                               On what his players need to do, Wilder said: “It has to come from within. It’s not going to come from outside, it’s got to come from players finding a big moment, a big half of football and finding a big result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        “The 17th game of that season 30 years ago it was similar. They were tight games and without looking at the record books I can’t imagine they were games where we were blasted out the water.                                                                                                                               “There was a togetherness which we’re seeing still to compete and do their best, but obviously it takes a hit with every game that goes by without that result. That group were tight, which they are now, and got that one win which set them off and it’s as basic as that.

I understand criticism.                                                                                                                                               “It comes with one big moment, one big performance, one big result as it did in that period 30 years ago which resulted in the team winning a few games in the second half of the season. That’s all we have to look for.”                                                                                                                               This group will have to wait a little longer to end their barren run of form in the top flight, with the Blades in FA Cup action on Saturday away to Sky Bet League One outfit Bristol Rovers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Wilder insisted nine players were unavailable for the clash at Palace and while unsure if any will return next weekend, he discussed a positive from the defeat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There was a debut late on for 16-year-old Antwoine Hackford, who became the club’s youngest player in the Premier League and almost scored when a close-range effort was blocked on the line by Joel Ward.                                                                                                                               “We’ll just keep assessing (the missing players) all the way. There’s obviously some long-term ones in there. I’m not going to disclose too much about that,” Wilder revealed.                                                                                                                                               “To lose nine players, especially in the Premier League and in the form we’re in, it’s certainly not going to give us the best opportunity of a result in this division.                                                                                                                               “You’re looking around and scratching your head at what you can do off the bench. I suppose one of the bright spots is Antwoine getting on to the pitch as a 16-year-old player. I’m delighted for him.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        First-half goals from Jeffrey Schlupp and Ebere Eze saw Palace return to winning ways for the first time since December 6.

The funding includes other efforts to examine advanced combat vehicle concepts, next-generation fire control technologies, XM913 chain gun development and even a vehicle protection technology demonstrator.The Bradley vehicle is already pushed to the maximum when it comes to using power to support everything from running the vehicle to controlling its payloads. Going hybrid would provide other benefits as well such as greater survivability by reducing thermal and acoustic signatures, better acceleration, increased lethality and more onboard power to support the possible incorporation of high-energy lasers, according to budget documents.The Army plans to conclude development efforts in the third quarter of FY22 and will then test prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Testing at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, will also take place beginning in the fourth quarter of FY22.Both testing efforts will come to a close in the first quarter of FY23, the justification books show.Earlier this year, a 3rd Infantry Division unit at Fort Stewart, Georgia, became the first unit equipped with the modernized M2A4 Bradley following the Army’s decade-long effort to upgrade the vehicles.The “A4″ variant is an engineering change proposal program that brings in new suspension and track upgrades. It also upgrades the electrical system and powertrain to restore lost mobility and integrate new technologies.The road to delivering the A4 has been rough. A year ago, the Army was testing a solution to address overheating and toxic gas production in the newest version of the Bradley’s turret battery, for example, which delayed the program by almost a year.Integrating electric capability into a vehicle like Bradley is challenging. but it will likely be far into the future when the Army considers fully electric options for combat vehicles or tanks.The Army’s recently released climate strategy lays out a goal to field fully electric tactical vehicles by 2050, but hybrid ones by 2035.Robotic platforms might be the first to be fully electric, or perhaps the Army’s still unfunded electric light reconnaissance vehicle effort.Additionally, the Army is continuing analysis and technology development of a next-generation powertrain for the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle that considers hybrid and a fully electric option. Oshkosh unveiled a hybrid version of the JLTV earlier this year.“It’s about size and weight,” Brig. Gen. Glenn Dean, program executive officer for ground combat systems, told Defense News in an interview last year. “If you took the amount of batteries with current technology that you would need to move an Abrams tank purely electrically, it’s bigger than the tank, so we have a packaging and storage problem when it comes to pure electric.”Jen Judson is an award-winning journalist covering land warfare for Defense News. She has also worked for Politico and Inside Defense. She holds a Master of Science in journalism from Boston University and a Bachelor of Arts from Kenyon College.At least five states are sending their aging M113 armored personnel carriers to Europe.At the GEOINT Symposium in Denver, Army officials say the conflict in Ukraine validates their approach to modernization and training.“In previous wars, the difference between a good decision and a bad decision may be minutes,” the general said. “In the future battlespace, that difference between a good decision and a bad decision may be seconds or milliseconds.”The Army is getting serious about future interceptor for its next-generation Integrated Air-and-Missile Defense System that is more capable of defeating complex threats like hypersonic weapons, according to a review of FY23 budget documents."

Are you ready?  This afternoon, when markets are convulsing mere milliseconds after the Fed Announcement, MBS Live members will know what's going on before anyone else. The accuracy and speed of our real-time price stream and alerts is unmatched.  Yesterday brought a brief reprieve for bonds after the first 2 days of the week threatened to confirm a big picture shift toward higher rates (or at least to build a case for such things).  But much like the brief rally in the middle of last week, yesterday's rally proved to be a head fake, only this time, it was even less convincing.  In fact, it took place entirely within the confines of the weeks-long uptrend in rates (white lines in the chart).  Now today, bonds started out in significantly weaker territory after overnight trade headlines rocked both sides of the market (good for stocks, bad for bonds).   subscribers can get caught up with that move  HERE  .  The losses are already pushing the upper limit of the shorter-term trend.  1.90-1.94 is an important line in the sand for yields.  It separates the summertime surge from the rest of the long-term rally with a very clear high in mid-September and a very clear low in early July.  These sorts of inflection points CAN be targeted as ceilings that motivate bond buyers to get more aggressive, but they can also be lines in the sand that signify a shift into a longer term uptrend in rates.  I've been concerned about the latter ever since August's big rally.  By then, yields had fallen far enough and for long enough to put 2019 on par with many other long-term bond rallies.  To make that list, a rally needs to have covered at least 100bps.  The chart below gives examples of the market movement that has followed those rallies.  The 2 best case scenarios are seen in 2011 and 2015.  Of the two, 2011 bears more similarity to 2019.  That is worth some small consolation as we've already almost matched the initial rebound in late 2011.  If the pattern were to perfectly repeat itself (it won't, but just for the sake of argument), yields would soon drop back to recent lows and then rise back up to 1.90%-ish by March 2020.  In more dire scenarios, we're looking at another several months of weakness, and notably, in the 2009/10 example, that could be followed by another 8-12 months of volatile, sideways momentum before the next true rally emerges.  I'm not sayin this WILL happen, but it is something you need to be prepared for.  We don't know how long the weakness will last or how far it will go, but all other things being equal, the size and scope of 2019's rally make weakness more likely than strength for the rest of the year.  A former originator, Matthew began writing for Mortgage News Daily in 2007, covering a wide range of topics.

The self-styled daredevil died Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020,  BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) — A California man who said he wanted to fly to the edge of outer space to see if the world is round has died after his home-built rocket blasted off into the desert sky and plunged back to earth.  “Mad"" Mike Hughes was killed on Saturday afternoon after his rocket crashed on private property near Barstow, California.  Waldo Stakes, a colleague who was at the rocket launch, said Hughes, 64, was killed.  The Science Channel said on Twitter it had been chronicling Hughes' journey and that “thoughts & prayers go out to his family & friends during this difficult time.”  “It was always his dream to do this launch,” the Twitter message said.  A video on TMZ.com showed the rocket taking off, with what appears to be a parachute tearing off during the launch. The steam-powered rocket streaks upward, then takes around 10 seconds to fall straight back to earth. Shrieks can be heard as the rocket plows into the desert.  Freelance journalist Justin Chapman, who was at the scene, said the rocket appeared to rub against the launch apparatus, which might have caused the mishap with the parachute.  In March 2018, Hughes propelled himself about 1,875 feet (570 meters) into the air before a hard landing in the Mojave Desert in California. He said in a video that his goal was to eventually fly to the edge of outer space to determine for himself whether the world is round.  “I don't want to take anyone else's word for it,” he said in the video, posted on the BBC News website. “I don't know if the world is flat or round.”  In another video, Hughes said he also wanted “to convince people they can do things that are extraordinary with their lives.”  “My story really is incredible,” Hughes once told The Associated Press. “It’s got a bunch of story lines — the garage-built thing. I’m an older guy. It’s out in the middle of nowhere, plus the Flat Earth. The problem is it brings out all the nuts also.”  "

Like covid-19, the illness it caused spread rapidly in communities because no one was immune to it yet.",nwaonline.com," If your school closed because of the novel coronavirus, you have something in common with kids growing up 100 years ago. In 1918, schools closed temporarily in response to a new swine flu virus. Like covid-19, the illness it caused spread rapidly in communities because no one was immune to it yet. Did students still have homework during the 1918 flu closures? Not much, according to Debbie Schaefer-Jacobs, curator in the Division of Cultural and Community Life at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Teachers probably sent reading assignments home, but schoolwork was minimal. If students wanted to practice spelling, they used alphabet or speller boards, which were popular learning toys at that time. Outside of school, kids kept busy with chores. Many children also had jobs, from delivering newspapers to helping on farms and even working in factories. That began to change in the 1930s when the government enacted laws regulating how much children could work. What was it like to go to school a century ago? More than half of the student population attended country or rural schools, while the rest went to city schools. At city schools, your classmates were about your age, but country schools often had students of different ages in a single classroom. States required children to attend school only through eighth grade. Sometimes older kids in country schools stayed longer to help with younger pupils, getting on-the-job training to later become teachers, Schaefer-Jacobs said. Most kids walked to school, although some rode horses or donkeys. In the 1930s, wagons began transporting students from rural areas to city schools. Until 1954, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (in Brown v the Board of Education) that segregated education was against the law, the vast majority of black students and white children attended separate schools. Children in the 1900s studied many of the same subjects you do today, such as reading, writing and math. Students used a book called Webster's Speller, and reading assignments were challenging.    An alphabet, or speller board, was a popular learning tool in 1918. (National Museum of American History)   ""Kids back then were reading speeches that presidents gave,"" Schaefer-Jacobs said. The curriculum also included Bible studies — even in public, nonreligious schools — along with penmanship and civics education. To practice penmanship or work on math problems, students wrote with chalk or charcoal on a slate — a piece of wood with special coating. ""A slate was similar in size to a tablet or an iPad mini,"" Schaefer-Jacobs said. Slates were noisy when dropped on desks, so some manufacturers wrapped the edges in yarn or fabric and sold them as ""noiseless"" slates.    Students used wrote on slates with chalk to work on math problems or practice penmanship. (National Museum of American History)   Because of the Civil War and World War I, schools focused a lot on patriotism — loyalty and devotion to your country. Students performed music, put on plays and wrote essays to showcase their civic pride. As the United States experienced a massive wave of immigration from the 1880s until 1920, schools also taught patriotism to foreign-born students. In fact, so many people immigrated to America that city schools offered classes at night to accommodate more students. Physical education (PE) looked a bit different in the early 1900s. In city schools, students exercised in a gymnasium or worked on strength and mobility at their desks using ""Indian clubs"" — wooden clubs that look like big bowling pins. ""In country schools, there wasn't an emphasis on PE because those kids were working on farms, getting plenty of physical labor,"" Schaefer-Jacobs said.    ""Indian clubs"" helped kids build strength as part of their PE classes. (National Museum of American History/Richard Strauss)   Older students in country schools also helped with physical tasks: Boys hauled wood for the stoves that heated the classrooms, and girls pumped drinking water from wells. Most city kids had enough time to walk home for lunch, while rural students took food to eat at school, packed in a metal pail or tin.    Kids at country schools brought food to eat at school. They would have used this aluminum lunch pail for milk or soup. (National Museum of American History)   As you continue learning at home, remember that school closures are nothing new.

Previously sealed files on the 1964 killings of the three men have been released for public viewing. (Getty Images)Nearly six decades after the brutal murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, never-before-seen records from the investigation into their deaths have been released to the public.The killings of James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Neshoba County 57 years ago sparked a wave of national grief and outrage, leading to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.And now, the previously sealed materials on the investigation into their deaths, which date from 1964 to 2007 and include research notes, witness testimonies and photographs, among other records, have been made available for public viewing at the William F Winter Archives and History Building in Jackson.The three men, who were all in their 20s and part of the Freedom Summer Project, an effort to attempt to register as many black voters as possible in Mississippi, had been investigating the burning of a black church near Philadelphia, Mississippi when they went missing in June of 1964.They had been arrested by a Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff named Cecil Price for allegedly speeding on the afternoon of 21 June, according to the FBI.Shortly after their release, they were followed by members of the Ku Klux Klan in what the FBI called a “preordained plan”. The three men were never heard from again.The case went on to become known as “Mississippi Burning” after investigators found the station wagon the three men were believed to have been travelling in charred.Eventually, however, agents acting on an informant tip were able to locate and exhume the bodies of all three men from below a dam on a local farm.All three men had appeared to have been badly beaten and shot at point blank range.More than a dozen suspects, including Deputy Price and his boss Sheriff Rainey were indicted and arrested. After years of courtroom battles, seven of 18 defendants were found guilty, including Price, but not on murder charges.One individual, Edgar Ray Killen, a Baptist preacher, was eventually convicted of manslaughter on 21 June 2005, the 41st anniversary of the slayings.Previously, Killen had been able to walk free after one juror refused to convict a Baptist preacher, according to the FBI.Then-Mississippi attorney general Jim Hood officially closed the investigation into the three deaths in 2016, with Killen dying in prison two years later in 2018."

I have decided not to celebrate my birthday this year. There is the threat of coronavirus and everyone needs to take extreme precautions to control its spread,"" the 65-year-old former Goa Chief Minister said. ""There is also a grave threat of the whole of Goa becoming a desert as neighbouring Karnataka is all set to divert water from our lifeline Mhadei. It is time to gear up to save our mother Mhadei,"" he said. Kamat urged the people in Goa to take precautions in view of coronavirus scare and and also get ready to participate in an agitation to save Mhadei. In August 2018, an inter-state water disputes tribunal, after hearing over two-decade-old Mhadei river water sharing dispute between Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra, had allotted 13.42 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) (including 3.9 TMC for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha river basin) to Karnataka and 1.33 TMC to Maharashtra. Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra governments have challenged several provisions of the award. Goa has claimed that construction of the Kalasa-Banduri water diversion project, across the river, to divert water from the Mhadei basin to the basin of the Malaprabha river in Karnataka, would cause ""ecological devastation"" in Goa.  Read more India Regional News  "

Article content The Aug. 14 event was intended to promote inclusivity and reestablish the traditional roles of Two-Spirit people in Anishinaabe society. The grand entry was led by Couchiching First Nation Chief Brian Perrault holding a pride flag, followed closely by Garrett Guilbault, a traditional dancer from Sagkeeng First Nation in Manitoba. Attendees were also treated to a sunrise ceremony, a fish fry and prize giveaways.  The powwow was part of an effort by Grand Council Treaty #3 to establish an LGBTQ2S  council alongside its already existing Elders, youth, women’s and men’s councils. The powwow was meant to be part of a LGBTQ2S  awareness campaign that began during Pride Month in June. In a news release, GCT3 LGBTQ2S  coordinator Waawaate Fobister called the gathering “a powerful stepping stone to restore and strengthen the Anishinaabe traditional values and recall practices of the Two-Spirit.” “This historic event will be the first of its kind in the area, with a celebration of Life and resurgence,” Fobister said. “It will serve communities, youth, leaders, knowledge keepers and spiritual care providers.” GCT3 Ogichidaa (Grand Chief) Francis Kavanaugh said he is “pleased to see this step in including LGBTQ2S  citizens in our governance structures and way of life. Only by ensuring all voices can be heard can we ensure that we work towards removing barriers for the most vulnerable.” The powwow’s cultural lead and master of ceremonies Ron Mandamin — who happens to be from Shoal Lake #39 — said that his home community was a great choice to host the event.

Article content “When the Grand Council was seeking out a place, they knew that the community I come from is very open-minded and well-equipped for today’s trends and changes in society,” he said in a phone interview. “Shoal Lake #39 is very accepting in terms of different cultures and diverse backgrounds. And, our Elders and educators have essentially [always been] cornerstones for the revitalization of language and culture in the Treaty 3 area.” Regarding the powwow itself, Mandamin said that the gathering helped provide necessary healing, and that in the end, the ceremonies achieved their goals — both literally and figuratively — with flying colours. “All powwows are celebrations, and they celebrate and can encompass different things,” he said. “For instance, one powwow that we did last year was solely for reconciliation. This powwow in Shoal Lake was a celebration honouring the spiritual name that the [LGBTQ2S  Council] was given, and a celebration of an event that has not happened in our catchment ever, not since the Treaty was signed. “I was incredibly in awe, because in the past, recent and distant, this way of life was not accepted, and it’s still shadowed by many misconceptions and uneducated awareness of what LGBTQ is in society. This powwow celebrated a group of people that were shunned, suppressed, ridiculed and often abused, sometimes to the point of death. It was a revitalization of culture that was lost and forgotten by way of force, fear, and colonization. We are breaking those barriers and rebuilding those bridges.” bcarver@postmedia.com      Share this article in your social network                "

Winds of change: Larry Fink is the founder of Blackrock, which manages £7.5trillion of asset 'It is not a social or ideological agenda. It is not woke. It is capitalism, driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees, customers, suppliers, and communities your company relies on to prosper. This is the power of capitalism.'Insisting the 'fair pursuit of profit' and 'long-term profitability' was key to success, he said firms must also 'create value for and be valued by' society as well as shareholders.'We focus on sustainability not because we're environmentalists, but because we are capitalists,' added Fink, whose own fortune is valued at £800million.His annual 'Dear CEO' missive regularly causes a stir and his comments come just a week after fund manager Terry Smith attacked Unilever, saying it had 'lost the plot' and was 'obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business'.Fink also used this year's letter – entitled The Power of Capitalism – to warn that firms rolling back flexible working 'do so at their peril'.'Companies expected workers to come to the office five days a week. Mental health was rarely discussed in the workplace. And wages for those on low and middle incomes barely grew. 'That world is gone,' he said of life before the pandemic. 'Companies not adjusting to this new reality and responding to their workers do so at their own peril.' Blackrock manages £7.5trillion of savers' cash in a host of funds and has huge influence over the companies in which it holds stakes.Rather than selling out from carbon-intensive firms, Blackrock prefers to remain an investor and persuade them to change their ways.   Green future: Rather than selling out from carbon intensive companies, Blackrock instead prefers to remain an investor and persuade companies to change their waysBut the money manager has come up against stiff opposition for its agenda which focuses on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.Critics have accused Blackrock and Fink himself of 'woke posturing' and behaving like an 'activist' investor.Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets in the City, said: 'Chief executives privately complain of the pious brigade that ignore the messy realities of life and doing business.'The US state of West Virginia this week said it would no longer use a Blackrock fund because of the damage it was doing to the economy. The fund was pushing companies in West Virginia to embrace net zero investment strategies that would have harmed the state's industry.West Virginia is known for its heavy industry, in particular its chemical and coal firms. It is the second largest coal producer in the US and ranks fifth in total energy production.West Virginia state treasurer Riley Moore said: 'I have a duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are managed in a responsible, financially sound fashion which reflects the best interests of our state and country, and I believe doing business with Blackrock runs contrary to that duty.'Blackrock has urged companies to embrace net zero investment strategies that would harm the coal, oil and natural gas industries, while increasing investments in Chinese companies that subvert national interests and damage West Virginia's manufacturing base and job market.'

I've had OCD since I was in elementary school. So, yes. I do have the right to talk about it. Thanks.''  Lili made her initial comments during an appearance on 'The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon', when talking about her character in 'Hustlers', who would throw up every time she got nervous.  The actress said the fake vomit they used for the movies would trigger her OCD, because she can't stand seeing ''floaters in water''.  She explained: ''It was actually animal crackers and Sprite mixed together. I thought I was going to have a problem here because I have this really like, OCD thing with floaters in water and in drinks. Like if my drink has a little floater in it, I'm like [gags], get it out. That's when I want to throw up! So having a cup of something that basically looked like 'floaters' in water was like my worst nightmare.''  Lili has been open with her mental health battle in the past, and recently spoke about the different ways she has been affected by depression.  She said: ''Depression has affected me in so many ways. It's something that never goes away. I've experienced depression and anxiety. Not constantly, but I'm still experiencing it. I have spells of time where I feel completely unmotivated, I don't want to do anything and I question myself. I don't know how to handle stress very well.''  And the actress credits therapy for helping her.  She added: ''Seeing the therapist allowed me to be understood. The goal for me has been to always leave therapy feeling a couple of inches taller. Feeling like I've alleviated myself of a problem by learning how to solve it. Not everything has a straight answer - it's not just going to take one session - but I start to think, 'I've grown, I've done this, I've figured this out, now can I go off into the world and try to put what I've learned into action.' That's how I look at therapy. I am not crazy, and I am not problematic. I am just a human who's feeling something in a different way than some other people would.''  "

Ihr Verhalten könne Schaden im realen Leben anrichten, erklärte der Kurznachrichtendienst zur Begründung in der Nacht zum Mittwoch. Mehr als 7000 Accounts, die QAnon-Unterstützern zugerechnet würden, seien in den vergangenen Wochen dauerhaft gesperrt worden, sagten Twitter-Sprecher dem Fernsehsender CNBC und der ""New York Times"". Die Verbreitung der Inhalte von rund 150 000 weiteren Profilen werde eingeschränkt.Zu den von QAnon-Anhängern verbreiteten Behauptungen gehört unter anderem, dass es eine Verschwörung gegen US-Präsident Donald Trump in den tieferen Schichten des amerikanischen Regierungsapparats gebe. Außerdem behaupten sie, prominente Politiker der Demokratischen Partei in den USA ließen sich mit Hormonen behandeln, die aus dem Blut von Kindern gewonnen würden.Damit knüpfte QAnon an die ""Pizzagate""-Episode aus dem Jahr 2016 an. Damals rückte ein bewaffneter Mann in eine Pizzeria in Washington ein, nachdem er im Netz gelesen hatte, dass diese als Tarnung für ein von Trumps damaliger Gegenkandidatin Hillary Clinton und anderen Demokraten betriebenes Pädophilen-Netzwerk dienen solle.QAnon-Symbole wurden in den vergangenen Jahren von Anhängern immer wieder in die Kamera bei Auftritten von Trump gehalten. Unterstützer der Theorien sind inzwischen auch verstärkt in der Republikanischen Partei aktiv.Twitter erklärte, mit QAnon verbundene Inhalte sollen nicht mehr in Trends und Empfehlungen auftauchen und Weblinks beim Hochladen blockiert werden. Facebook hatte im Mai 20 Accounts und fünf Seiten entfernt, die QAnon zugerechnet werden. Zur Begründung hieß es, sie hätten gegen das Verbot ""nicht-authentischen Verhaltens"" bei dem Online-Netzwerk verstoßen./so/DP/easQuelle: dpa-AFX                                "

However, due to some “errors”, it has preliminarily indicated the net loss for the year should be up to $30.6m. Due to the identified errors, Gan said it would be unable to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission within the prescribed time without “unreasonable effort or expense”.  Gan said it needed more time to complete its annual report as some unaudited financial statements “should be restated and no longer relied upon”.  Gan, whose chief executive is Dermot Smurfit Jnr, added that management had determined a “material weakness” existed in its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of three quarterly periods in 2021. This related to the “completeness and accuracy of accounting” for software development costs and the timing of revenue recognition where performance obligations were ongoing, resulting in misstatements. “The company’s preliminary analysis indicates that, after adjusting for these errors, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2021, will be between approximately $30m and $30.6m,” read the filing.  “No assurances can be given that the additional review and procedures in connection with the issuance of the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, will not lead to information that may require further adjustments that would negatively impact the previously announced results of operations.”   In Gan’s preliminary results announcement, the company said revenue for 2021 was $125.4m, up from $35.2m the previous year. Gan said its growth was driven by its Coolbet acquisition in January 2021.      "

But paying off ANC salaries with the IMF loan is a major red flag...,thesouthafrican.com,"                                  Tito Mboweni has landed himself in hot water with the opposition on Friday, after he claimed that the multi-billion dollar IMF loan granted to South Africa for COVID-19 relief purposes could also contribute towards ANC salaries.    Tito Mboweni ‘could spend IMF loan on ANC salaries’    The response, submitted for a Parliamentary question fielded by the DA, stated that salary payments could be supplemented by the ‘loan disbursements’. The ANC has failed to pay their workers for several months in this calendar year, and it seems the finance minister is eyeing an escape route through the IMF:    “The loan receipts (or disbursements) will form part of the National Revenue Fund to be used to support existing government programmes, which could include salary payments.”Tito Mboweni    What was South Africa’s IMF loan meant for?    However, this could prove to be quite problematic. The IMF loan was meant to be used for the following pursuits:    The support health and frontline services.Solving the balance of payments problems caused by the pandemic.The protection of the vulnerable.Support for economic reform and job creation.Stabilising the public debt was also listed as a priority.    Plans to pay-off ANC salaries branded “a failure”    Leon Schreiber is the Shadow Minister for Public Service and Administration. He’s outraged that Mboweni has ‘failed to stand up’ to his colleagues, and claims his opposite number has now ‘reneged’ on the terms of the IMF loan.    “It is now public knowledge that his economic reform crusade has been rejected outright by his Cabinet colleagues who have repeatedly shown a willingness to send South Africa over the fiscal cliff through unrestrained spending.”“By admitting that the IMF loan could be used to pay salaries, Mboweni has reneged on the spending commitments he made in his Letter of Intent to obtain financial support under the IMF’s emergency financing instrument. The LOI committed the government to use IMF emergency assistance for things like supporting health and frontline services.”“Tito Mboweni’s failure to hold the line and defend the public purse from marauding political interests in his own party will have far-reaching consequences on South Africa’s long term fiscal stability.”Leon Schreiber                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         "

Playing without All-Star slugger Aaron Judge and five of his teammates who also tested positive for COVID-19 recently, the Yankees won their second straight against rival Boston after dropping the first seven meetings this year. New York won two of three in a series originally set for four games before Thursday’s scheduled opener was postponed for testing and contact tracing. Boston, which has lost six of eight, left town with a half-game lead in the AL East over Tampa Bay, and seven in front of the fourth-place Yankees. Taillon (5-4) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings of four-hit ball in his 100th major league start, improving to 4-0 in his past five outings. Chad Green escaped a jam in the sixth to protect a three-run cushion.   Ryan LaMarre, just called up from the minors, added a two-run homer in the eighth — his first with the Yankees and first in the majors since September 2019. DJ LeMahieu extended his on-base streak to 30 games, longest in the big leagues this season, with a single that set up a third-inning run. New York’s no-name outfield of LaMarre, Greg Allen and Trey Amburgey began the night with 12 career home runs — fewest for a Bronx Bombers starting outfield trio since June 10, 1991. Not exactly Mantle, Maris and Berra — but not a problem on this night. Torres hit his fifth homer on an 0-2 pitch from Martín Pérez (7-6) leading off the second. Torres also homered his last time up Saturday night in a 3-1 victory that was called after six innings because of heavy rain. That gave him long balls in consecutive games for the first time since a three-game streak in June 2019. Odor reached on a bunt single leading off the fifth and scored on Greg Allen’s sacrifice fly. He added a two-run homer in the seventh to make it 5-0. TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: 1B Christian Arroyo strained his left hamstring in the third when he went into a split stretching for a throw. He was replaced by Bobby Dalbec. It was the first career appearance at first base for Arroyo, who has played all the other infield positions. Before the game, manager Alex Cora said Arroyo had earned more playing time, and he and the team were comfortable with him at first base. … OF/1B Danny Santana (left quadriceps strain) is expected to come off the injured list Monday after finishing a rehab assignment Sunday with Triple-A Worcester. … All-Star SS Xander Bogaerts doubled twice after sitting out Saturday night with a sore left wrist. He was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the eighth with Boston trailing 7-0. Yankees: RHP Luis Severino threw 30 pitches to hitters, simulating two innings. “I thought he threw the ball really well. Looks strong, healthy,” manager Aaron Boone said. Severino will likely face hitters again in five or six days before potentially beginning a minor league rehab assignment. He hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2019 after having Tommy John surgery, and his return was slowed because of a groin injured sustained June 12 in a rehab appearance. … Boone said RHP Darren O’Day’s season is likely over due to a left hamstring injury. … Boone said all six Yankees players who recently tested positive for the coronavirus are doing pretty well as far as symptoms are concerned. RHP Jonathan Loaisiga, one of those players on the COVID-19 injured list, was expected to fly to New York and rejoin the team by Tuesday, according to Boone. … RHP Michael King (bruised right middle finger) still feels discomfort and won’t throw for another five to seven days. … Amburgey exited after four innings with a right hamstring cramp and was replaced in the lineup by Brett Gardner. … A leaping LaMarre hit the right field wall with a loud thud trying to catch Christian Vázquez’s fifth-inning double and was shaken up. LaMarre was checked by Boone and two athletic trainers, but remained in the game. LaMarre was called up from Triple-A before the game to replace OF Tim Locastro, who was placed on the 10-day injured list with a torn right ACL. UP NEXT Red Sox: Shuffle off to Buffalo for the opener of a three-game series Monday night against the division-rival Blue Jays. RHP Nick Pivetta (7-4, 4.30 ERA) faces Toronto RHP Ross Stripling (3-5, 4.34). Yankees: Following an off day, RHP Domingo Germán (4-5, 4.72 ERA) starts Tuesday night at home against Philadelphia RHP Aaron Nola (6-5, 4.53) in the opener of a two-game interleague series.

""I know Lewis wants to be in the fastest car so there is a mutual outcome. It is the obvious pairing going forward.  ""There are not many places where Lewis will have the environment and framework that will give him the best base for his ambitions.  ""We know what we get with him and we have a trusting relationship.
